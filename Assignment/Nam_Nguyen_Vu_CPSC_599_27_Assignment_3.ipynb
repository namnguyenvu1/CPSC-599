However, if we pass the number of topic too low, we can't fit the document into those topics as there are not enough topics. And if we pass the number of topics too high, we will encounter the situation in which there are similar topics. And I think that passing the high number of topic could lead to long fitting time.\n",

The reason is that if we choose the number of topic to be 3, I think there are not enough topics.

For instance, there might be cases in which the dataset seems to have lots of neutral comments so adding a class called \"neutral\" will have in that case. But again, it's all up to the dataset that we have and it's the best to have the set of classes that could best represent the dataset.\n",

As a result, freezing layers could help to limit the risk by limiting the ability of the model to adapt to the training data."

        "- Step 3a: (Optional) Modify the layers if needed. This step is not required. However, it might be needed. The reason is that for our specific tasks, we might need to add a final layer for instance.\n",
        "- Step 3b: (Optional) Freeze the layers. As discussed above, if there are pre-trained layers that we want to prevent them from being updated during fine-tuning, we can freeze those layers.\n",
        "- Step 4: Fine-tune the model. In this step, we will train the pre-trained model on our specific dataset. Depends on our needs, we can update the weight of the model in part or in full. Some methods could be used in this step are gradient descent and backpropagation.\n",
        "- Step 5: Evaluate the model performance. Now, after fine-tuning, we should evaluate the performance of our model using a seperate dataset to assess how well our model perform for our specific tasks. Some other evaluation methods which could be used are BLEU and BLEURT, but this is totally up to our need.\n",

        "- 2. Training time is way larger to train models from scratch. The reason is that train models from scratch require much more computational power. In addition, if we train model from scratch, we need to train all of the parameters while with fine-tuning, we can choose to only fine-tune a portion of the model.\n",
        "- 3. Dataset needed. To train a model from scratch, we normally need a much larger dataset. However, with fine-tuning model, we might only need a fraction of the dataset which focus on our specific tasks.\n",
        "- 4. Hardware needed. To train a model from scratch, it normally requires much more complex hardware. But to fine-tune models, it could be done with even consumer hardware (For instance, fine-tune 7B LLM could be done with a GPU with less than 16GB of VRAM)\n",
        "- 5. Generalization. Normally, if we choose to fine-tune a pre-trained model, it often leads to better generalization, especially when the our purpose is similar to the original tasks that the model has been pre-trained on. The reason is that the model has learned features that are transferable across tasks."
