        "- The third potential feature is the contextual feature. This feature will consider the surrounding words or labels in a sequence like the previous or later words of the target words\n",
        "- The fourth feature is n-gram feature. This feature represent the local structure of the sequence. For instance, if we know the n-gram (like bi or tri or something else), then that could be an useful feature for sequence-labeling classification.\n",

        "B) Explain why these features tend to be useful for these types of sequence labeling tasks. (10 marks)\n",
        "- The first feature is the Part-of-Speech Tag feature: The reason that this feature is potential is that it could provide grammartical information about words such as their grammartical roles in sentences. By doing so, it could help the model to familiarize with patterns based on words categories so that the model could perform better in tasks like name entity recognition (NER) or chunking.\n",
        "- The second feature - word identity feature: The reason that make this feature could be useful is because it allows the model to recognize specific words or their base forms, which could be important for identifying sentiments or dequence labels. For instance, in NER tasks, if we know that \"Calgary\" refers to a location, then it will be beneficial for us to improve the labelling accuracy.\n",
        "- The third feature - contextual feature: The reason that this feature could be useful is because words are often influenced by their surrounding words as those will likely to give information of the context that the target words is used for. For instance, in chunking task, if we know that a noun is preceded by a determiner, then it's an indicator of the start of a noun phrase.\n",
        "- The fourth feature is n-gram feature. This feature capture local structure in the documents, which could be useful for understanding the context of the documents that we are examining. For example, in POS tagging, then the bigram \"is swimming\" is likely to have the POS sequence of VB (verb base form) or VBG which is (Verb Gerund)\n",
        "- The fifth feature is the words shape feature. This features will encode the visual characteristics of the words such as capitalization, or punctuation around the word. The reason that this feature could be helpful is that it could provide the model the information about the words' orthographic patterns which might assist the model in task like sequence-labeling classification."

Finally, it contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.  The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves, racing back out from the black hole.  Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal- like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe -- a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.  The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.  The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass.  The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.  An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV. \n",

If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards.

Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal. He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides down into the hole.  The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it.

For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed. Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave.

The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.

Something about the movement is endearing, the way it experiments with each piece -- less like a massacre and more like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set.  Suddenly, a massive, lumbering creature SMASHES down in front of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to scuttle away. Too slow. The larger organism brings one club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a moment, it lifts its claw -- the two animals have become one.  The new organism lumbers away through the jungle, happily snapping its new claw at larger opponents. \n",

            "          Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON\r STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters... planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?  Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of\n",
            "          existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.\r  The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl, spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.  The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves, racing back out from the black hole.  Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal- like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe -- a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.  The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.  The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass.  The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.  An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV. \n",

            "COOPER: One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards.

A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.  Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.  He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.  Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault code and resets the computer.

At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across -- the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.  Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal. He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides down into the hole.  The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it.

For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed. Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows, and another, until the cave entrance is full.  Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock.

Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete, and it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much luck.  Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.

Finally, it contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.  The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves, racing back out from the black hole.  Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal- like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe -- a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.  The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.  The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass.  The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.  An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV. \n",

The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night.  Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over it in a torrent.

As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal.  For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed. Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows, and another, until the cave entrance is full.  Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock.

Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete, and it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much luck.  Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.

Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck.  Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter.  Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes to catch the light.

The catcher YELLS out a warning.  Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward the town center above.

The robot is wearing a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.  Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with a click against the mirror-like floor.  Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.  Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the ship until it lights up.

From this height, it looks much the same as it has done for thousands of years.  Suddenly, a tiny black object appears, racing toward Earth.  The object SMASHES into a large satellite and races onward. Behind it, the satellite spins out of orbit in a cloud of fragments. EXT. BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT:  An old minor league stadium. The stands are barely halfway full. Cooper, his boys, and Cooper's father-in-law, DONALD, 60s, have a row to themselves behind the dugout.  Murph offers his grandpa some popcorn. DONALD: Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural. I want a hot dog. 8. fans look up at the night sky:\\r  A bright blue streak is tearing across it. It's beautiful. TOM: Is that a comet, Dad?\", \"COOPER: (shakes his head) Satellite. Big one. Probably Chinese.  Everyone watches the fireworks as the satellite burns up in the upper atmosphere.  After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but everyone has seen it plenty of times before.  Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop fly and the Yankees load the bases. Donald looks disgusted.\", \"INT. COOPER'S TRUCK -- NIGHT:  Cooper guides his truck along a potholed road. His father- in-law is riding shotgun; the boys are sleeping in the back.

Donald is on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke in the distance. The neighboring fields are BURNING. DONALD: Nelson's burning up his crops. Found some of the blight on the okra.

It means what can happen will happen. All kinds of things. Good or bad.

He's heard something.\", 'TOM: What about the tire? INT. TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER:  The truck is SMASHING through the cornfields as fast as Cooper can push it on three good tires. 12.  Murph is hurriedly firing up the laptop and connecting it to the directional antenna.  Cooper is straining to see through the cornstalks, scanning the horizon. OVER THERE-:  To the right, the dark shape of the Russian drone appears, flying low over the fields. Cooper jerks the wheel-- EXT. RIVER -- DAY:  The truck BURSTS out of the corn and SPLASHES across the river and into an old, abandoned suburban housing development in the valley below, planted over with corn.  Half a mile in front of them, the Russian drone is still hugging the ground. It has impossibly long, skinny wings, like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells. INT. TRUCK -- DAY:  Murph is fiddling with the computer. His older brother takes the computer from him and fires up emulation software.', \"COOPER: It's a Chinese military drone. Solar cells could power an entire farm.\", \"EXT. SUBURBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DAY:  Tom guides the truck from street to street, trying to chart a straight path across the fields. The truck BOUNCES as it SMASHES through an old picket fence.  Ahead, the drone is soaring, banking, pulling away. INT. TRUCK -- DAY:  Cooper is still trying to hack into the drone's control circuitry as they leave the development behind and begin to climb into the foothills of the Sierras. EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY:  Tom guides the truck along the spine of the hills. The drone soars overhead, making for the white tips of the Sierras. INT. TRUCK -- DAY:  Cooper is oblivious to the picturesque surroundings as he concentrates on the laptop.\", \"COOPER: Almost got it. Don't slow down.  In front of them, Tom and his brother watch as the drone plummets from view.\", \"DAD.:  Cooper looks up. Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of the hills falls away -- it's a three hundred-foot drop.  Tom locks up the brakes. EXT. RIDGELINE, HILLS -- DAY:  The truck skids to a halt inches from a precipitous drop.  Cooper climbs out, holding the laptop. Murph climbs out next to him, still pointing the Pringles can. TOM: We lost it. EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY FLOOR -- DAY:  The truck limps along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct golf course towards the massive hulk of the Russian drone,  Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save for the truck's engine WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as it cools.  Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone. TOM: How long do you think it's been up there, Dad?\", \"COOPER: Chinese mission control went down same as us, twenty years ago. It's been up there ever since.\", 'TOM: What was it doing flying so low?  Cooper reads the information pouring into his laptop. 15.', 'COOPER: It was looking for something. Intercepted some kind of signal.', 'MURPH: What are you going to do with it?', 'COOPER: Reprogram it. Give it something socially responsible to do like drive a combine or a tractor.', 'COOPER: We need all the help we can get, Murph. This thing has to adapt, just like the rest of us.  Cooper gently pries the control module out.', \"EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY:  It's a small school, so all the kids and parents waiting in front know exactly who's driving the pickup truck with half of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up. INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE, COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY:  Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an efficient-looking man, shakes his hand. PRINCIPAL: Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher.  Cooper smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive. 16.\", 'COOPER: What about college?', 'PRINCIPAL: The University of California only accepts a few hundred students a year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be realistic.', \"COOPER: You're ruling out college for him now? He's only fifteen.\", \"PRINCIPAL: I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score simply isn't high enough.\", 'COOPER: What are you, about a 36-inch waist?', \"PRINCIPAL: I'm not sure I see--\", \"COOPER: You're telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure my son's future?  Ms. Kelly stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the principal, takes on the appropriate look of offense.\", \"PRINCIPAL: I understand you're a well-educated man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?\", 'COOPER: Engineer.', \"PRINCIPAL: Frankly, the world doesn't need any more engineers. We didn't run out of trains or television sets or satellites.\", 'COOPER: Are we done?', 'PRINCIPAL: One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says that Murph brought a book to school about the lunar landings.  He slides an old textbook with a picture of a rocket on the cover across the desk to Cooper.', 'COOPER: One of my old textbooks. Murph liked the pictures.', \"MS. KELLY: This is one of the old federal textbooks. We've replaced them with corrected versions.\", 'COOPER: Corrected?', 'MS. KELLY: The new textbooks explain that the Apollo lunar missions were faked in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.', \"COOPER: You don't believe we went to the moon?\", 'MS. KELLY: I believe it was a brilliant piece of propaganda. The Soviets spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines.', 'COOPER: \"Useless machines\"? 18.  Cooper looks to the Principal for help. None is forthcoming.', 'MS. KELLY: Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of wastefulness and excess that the 20th century represented. Your children would be better off learning about this planet, rather than reading fantasies about leaving it.  Cooper is silent for a long moment.', \"COOPER: One of those useless machines they used to make was called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to find the cyst in my wife's brain before she died, rather than afterwards. And then my kids could have been raised by two parents, instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.  Ms. Kelly's face falls, ashen. Cooper swallows his anger. Most of it, anyway.\", 'INT. TRUCK, COUNTY SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY:  Cooper climbs into the truck, trying to hold it together. He PUNCHES the wheel.  The radio KEYS to life. He ignores it. Sits for a moment in misery. Finally he picks up the handset.', 'COOPER: Just tell him to power down the controllers for a couple minutes.', 'EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY:  Cooper pulls his truck up to a grimy-looking hangar. Pulls a tarp off of an ancient Piper Cub. Checks it over. INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY:  Cooper guides the plane along a long sliver of deserted beach. The radio crackles to life.', 'COOPER: Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission to enter your airspace.', \"EXT. GULF COAST -- DAY:  Below, a combine harvester fights its way up the dunes, trying to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in the soft sand.  A MAN waves up at Cooper's plane as it circles overhead.  Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.  He intercepts one of the combines as it trundles past, trying to reach the dunes. He pops open the cabin.  Inside is a mess of wires hooked into an auto-pilot not unlike the one he ripped out of the drone. He checks the fault code and resets the computer.  The man jogs over to meet him. RIGGS: Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em took off last night, looking for something. (points to dunes) Looks like they found it, too. I thought you were the man to see it.  Riggs starts walking up the dune. Cooper follows.  Below, on the beach, a dozen more combines and other farming vehicles are lined up at the tideline, warm gulf water lapping at their metal flanks. They are circling a deep crater. 20.  As they watch, an ancient autonomous SUB BEACHES itself, trying to reach the crater. EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY:  Cooper steps between the waiting machines and peers down into the crater.  At the very bottom is a ROUND BLACK BALL, about a foot across -- the same object we saw punch a hole in the side of a satellite. Every few seconds, it emits a distinctive CHIRP.  Cooper checks his rad meter. A tiny reading -- non-lethal. He takes off his watch and hands it to Riggs. Then he slides down into the hole.  The probe CHIRPS as Cooper slides down on top of it. He rubs a hand across its smooth composite bulk. familiar outline etched into the side of the probe:\\r  The stars and stripes of the old federal government.\", 'COOPER: Not exactly.', \"EXT. CRATER'S EDGE, BEACH -- DAY:  Using a rope and a winch, Cooper hauls the blackened probe out of the crater and onto the beach.  Cooper hefts it up and carries it to the back of his plane.\", \"COOPER: Space probe. Never seen one like it, though. Looks like it's been to hell and back.  The probe CHIRPS as Cooper belts it into the back.\", 'RIGGS: How do you think it wound up here?', 'COOPER: Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites would have been shot down by the Chinese twenty years ago.  Cooper looks at the probe for a second, admiring its form. 21.', \"INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT:  Donald is pouring a bottle of corn beer into a bubbling vat of chowder. He turns to watch Cooper work, amused.  The probe has been clamped to the kitchen table. Cooper works at the blackened case with a BLOWTORCH. Cooper gives up -- the torch hasn't made a scratch. The probe CHIRPS.\", \"COOPER: Well I don't know what the hell it's made of, but I can't crack it open.\", \"DONALD: Good. Clear it off the table so I can serve dinner.  Tom and Murph walk in. Murph's got another black eye. MURPH: I got suspended. Paul said anyone who believed we went to the moon was an idiot. So I hit him.\", \"COOPER: Good boy. Hand me the scanner.  Murph hands his dad a defibrillator he's modified for the purpose. He attaches the shock pads to the sides of the probe and turns on the power.  Numbers flash across the screen. Cooper hits a button on the controls and it PULSES.\", 'the defibrillator. After a moment, an image fills the screen:\\r  An ICE-COVERED PLANET nestled in the center of a system impossibly dense with stars. Murph stares, transfixed. MURPH: Where is that, dad?', \"COOPER: I don't know.  Cooper looks at the probe. 22.\", 'MURPH: But what about its mission? What about the information onboard?', \"COOPER: There's no one for it to report to. NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son. It got home too late.  Donald pulls his chowder off the boil and slides the pot unceremoniously onto the table.\", \"INT. DINING ROOM -- NIGHT:  The boys have gone to bed. Cooper and Donald are alone at the table. Donald hands Cooper another beer. DONALD: I heard your meeting at the school didn't go so well.  Cooper shakes his head in disgust.\", \"COOPER: Maybe it's better for everyone to forget what they did back then. Reminds us how far we've fallen.\", 'DONALD: (looks down,) When I was kid, it felt like they made something new every day. Some gadget or idea.', \"COOPER: It doesn't bother me that he can't go. It bothers me that he doesn't care.\", \"DONALD: Tom isn't the problem. He fits in this world just fine. You're the one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't belong here. You were born forty years too late, or forty years too early -- I don't know. My daughter knew it, god bless her. And your kids know it, too.  Donald drains his beer. Walks to the screen door. Stops, one hand on the frame. INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT:  Cooper flops down on his bed, fully clothed, exhausted. He stares up at the ceiling. This is his life. INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT:  The air is filled with a PIERCING NOISE.  Cooper BOLTS upright. Stumbles out the door. INT. HALLWAY, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT:  Cooper's boys are in the hallway, exhausted. Cooper, holding a baseball bat, makes his way down the stairs.  Cooper uses the bat to open the kitchen door. INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT:  Cooper steps in, Murph watching from behind him. 24.  The probe is clamped to the table, the chirp replaced with a DEAFENING SCREAM.:  Cooper, holding his ears, moves closer to the probe. He hits it with the paddles. No result.  He SMASHES it with the bat. Nothing. He HITS it AGAIN and AGAIN. Finally, the clamps break off chunks of the table and the probe slams to the ground and ROLLS toward the front door. As it rolls, it STOPS SHRIEKING.  Cooper and the others watch it roll toward the door. It stops at the wall. After a second, it begins SHRIEKING AGAIN.  Cooper grabs it and rolls it toward the front door. Once again, the movement shuts it up. EXT. PORCH, COOPER'S HOUSE -- NIGHT:  Cooper and his boys roll the probe out of the front door. It BUMPS down the front steps and comes to rest in the dirt. After a moment, the unholy RACKET starts up again.  Cooper keeps rolling it, but it doesn't seem to help. Murph looks up, sees the stars overhead. MURPH: Try a different direction.  As they roll the probe in a circle, its SHRIEK stops, then picks up again. Cooper zeroes in on the direction that keeps it quiet -- southwest -- and pushes it along in the dirt.\", \"COOPER: It's a fail-safe. It's going to annoy us into taking it home.  Cooper stops rolling the probe and, after a moment, it begins SHRIEKING again.\", 'TOM: What are we going to do?  Cooper gets a rope.', \"COOPER: We're going to get some sleep.  He begins tying the rope around the probe.\", \"INT. BEDROOM, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY:  Cooper wakes. He's been sleeping with a pillow wrapped around his head. The SHRIEK can be heard, but it's muffled, distant. 25. INT. KITCHEN, COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY:  Tom heads off for school with Donald. Murph, still suspended, looks up at Cooper, smiling. MURPH: What are we doing today?\", \"COOPER: You're staying here and cleaning the house.  Murph looks crestfallen. He looks out towards the yard. Cooper follows his stare.\", \"MURPH: But what if there is, dad? What if there's something we can salvage?  Cooper thinks it over. Murph scrambles to get his shoes. EXT. COOPER'S HOUSE -- DAY:  The shriek is still muffled. Cooper walks over to the well, putting in a pair of earplugs.  A line is staked off, leading down into the well below. Cooper begins hauling the line up.  As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK returns to its normal volume. Cooper rolls the probe out onto the ground. INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY:  The probe CHIRPS next to Murph in the backseat as Cooper spins the plane and guns the throttle and they bounce along the dusty runway and into the air. EXT. CALIFORNIA COAST -- DAY:  The tiny plane follows the mountains south. EXT. SKIES OVER LOS ANGELES -- DAY:  Cooper flies in low. Los Angeles looks much the same way it did in the early 20th century -- small settlements in Santa Monica and Downtown. Wildfires and earthquakes have shaken and burned what was left of the homes in between. 26. EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY, MALIBU -- DAY:  Cooper puts the plane down on the old highway and taxis up to a gas station. Ahead, the Coast Highway peters out and disappears beneath rows of wild grass -- Malibu has become ranchland, once again. EXT. GAS STATION, MALIBU -- DAY:  An OLD MAN looks up as Cooper steps out of the plane and checks it over.\", 'COOPER: Got any diesel?', \"OLD MAN: Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.  Cooper stretches the hose over to the plane. INT. PIPER CUB -- DAY:  Cooper rests a hand lightly on the controls as he follows the coast. Murph gazes out the window. In the backseat, the probe is HUMMING.  A light marine layer beneath them parts, revealing SANTA CRUZ ISLAND, a large, uninhabited island.  As Cooper soars over the island, the probe HUMS, insistent. MURPH: I think it's home.  Cooper circles the island until he finds a long, flat grassland in the center of the island. EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY:  The plane bounces and hops to a halt in waist-deep grass.  Murph and Cooper climb down from the plane. Cooper slings a rifle over his shoulder.  A few dozen yards from the plane they reach the tree line. Murph stops, mesmerized by a patch of weeds studded with bright red -- strawberries. MURPH: Dad, what are these things?\", \"COOPER: I don't know. Don't touch them. 27.  Cooper spots something in the foliage ahead that looks a little off. He walks over.  He pokes at the undergrowth with his rifle. The rifle CLANKS against something metal. Cooper reaches -- it's a camouflage scrim. He gently pulls it aside, revealing a chemical transport truck.  Cooper steps back, alarmed. He brings up his rifle.\", \"EXT. CLEARING, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY:  Cooper walks through a glade. He stops to get his bearings. Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk of the tree is red hot.  Cooper steps back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged chimney stack. He looks up: the tree is venting steam.\\r  Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive tanks. The tanks are filling with a bubbling liquid -- some kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him.  Cooper finally catches up with Murph at the edge of a clearing.\", \"COOPER: Careful. There's some kind of underground facility here. We might...\", 'Cooper notices his son is frozen, staring at something:\\r  Standing bolt upright in the middle of the clearing, wearing an old straw hat, is an eight-foot-tall military spec ROBOT. MURPH: Is it still... alive?', \"COOPER: Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't made them for thirty years. I've never seen one intact before.  Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its alloy frame heavily tarnished and weather-beaten. It looks like it might have been standing here for decades. 28.  Cooper moves closer to it, looking into its blackened eyes. He steps back, clearly a little spooked.\", \"MURPH: But can't we take it back? You could fix it up, get him to do chores.\", \"COOPER: No. I don't know what this place is, but we're leaving.  Murph, ignoring his father, steps forward to touch the robot.  Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into action, picking up the boy and hoisting him up to eye level.  Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.  The robot turns, dropping the boy, RIPS the rifle from Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the side of the water tank. Cooper punches him, then winces in agony.  Murph picks up the rifle and begins HITTING the robot as hard as he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses Cooper calmly in the clipped tones of a US marine.\", 'ROBOT: Tell the boy to stop hitting me.', 'COOPER: We were just looking for salvage.', 'BRAND: Is that what they call stealing these days?', \"COOPER: I didn't know it belonged to anyone. 29.\", \"BRAND: It doesn't.\", \"COOPER: You've got me wrong, lady.\", \"BRAND: Really? You're not the kind of guy who turns a combat marine with a supercomputer for a brain into a riding lawn mower?  Cooper says nothing -- she's not that far off the mark. TARS: Don't forget your gun.\", \"COOPER: (points at Tars) Word of advice -- careful with that thing. When the war was over, they didn't know when to stop fighting.\", \"BRAND: I'd trust him a lot more than I'd trust you. Keep moving.  Cooper backs up to his plane. Tars follows him.  Suddenly, in the plane, the probe emits a high-pitch SQUEAL. Tars responds instantly, striding past Cooper to the plane. He sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.\", 'COOPER: Wait a second--  Tars TEARS the door off the plane. Reaches inside and pulls out the probe. The woman looks at it, stunned.', \"BRAND: Get it inside. INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR, UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY:  Brand waves at a security camera and the lift begins to glide diagonally down a tunnel that cuts hundreds of feet below the island's surface. She keeps her weapon shouldered.\", \"COOPER: Now who's stealing from who?\", \"BRAND: This doesn't belong to you.\", \"COOPER: You're right. It belongs to NASA, which shut down thirty years ago when the federal government ran out of money.  Brand says nothing. The elevator slows to a stop at the bottom of the tunnel. Heavy BLAST DOORS grind open and Brand motions for Cooper to step forward.\", 'INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER -- DAY:  They step into a vast underground facility. Standing in the center, braced by a launch tower, is a ten story tall rocket. Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.  Cooper, stunned, looks at Brand.', 'COOPER: Who are you people?', 'OLD ENGINEER: Where did you find it?', 'COOPER: Galveston.', \"BRAND'S FATHER: (thinking it over) Of course. It must have been looking for Canaveral.  Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose built rig. DOYLE, 40s, an engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.\", \"COOPER: Canaveral's been gone for thirty years.  Brand ignores him.  Doyle looks up from his monitor, frustrated.\", \"DOYLE: It's not responding to the handshake. I can't open anything on primary.  Brand looks up at Cooper. BRAND: What did you do to it?\", \"COOPER: Nothing. I got something off of it.  Cooper looks around. There's a safety station on the wall with a battery powered defibrillator.\", \"OLD ENGINEER: Of course. The high voltage allows you to image the entire memory unit at once.  Information begins appearing on the terminal's screen.\", 'COOPER: Most of the disk was noise. Couple of clean sectors, though.  Suddenly, the monitor starts pulling good data off of the probe. The older man and Doyle begin sorting through it.  Cooper smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed.  The footage of the ice-covered planet Cooper saw earlier pops onto the screen.  The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the images.', 'DOYLE: It found something.', \"COOPER: There aren't any planets like that anywhere near earth. Not even if this thing was gone for thirty years.  Brand looks at Cooper, appraising. She turns to the older engineer.\", \"BRAND: He's heard enough.

Cooper points to a telemetry unit that is being repaired by a robot on a nearby bench.\", \"DOYLE: Why not? We've tested it a hundred times.\", 'COOPER: The power supply is no good. If the voltage fluctuates under load, the unit will fail.', 'BRAND: Now how could you possibly know that?', 'COOPER: Bought thirty of them off a guy in Florida. Had to rebuild every last one.', 'CUT TO:: INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY:  Cooper and Murph have been locked in an abandoned machine shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in various states of disrepair.

(off his look) Thank you. We tested the telemetry board you warned us about. It failed under high voltage, just as you said. Come with me, please.  Case strides off. INT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY:  The lights dim as Brand's father brings up a schematic of our solar system. Case points to the picture of the ice planet recovered from the probe. CASE: You're right, Mr. Cooper. The planet you saw is a long way from earth. A very long way indeed.  Brand looks down. Case notices. FATHER): Go ahead, John.  Brand's father taps a few keys and the schematic he built fifty years beforehand flickers onto the screen. BRAND'S FATHER: It's a wormhole. A shortcut leading to a galaxy on the far side of the universe. We found it fifty years ago.  Cooper looks at the animatic, taking it in. CASE: Based on the information on the probe, we're finally preparing to send the manned mission.\", \"COOPER: That rocket doesn't have enough thrust or fuel to get you to Jupiter.\", 'CASE: The main ship was built in orbit. It has nuclear engines, with enough fuel to last for several years.  Cooper looks at the schematic.', \"COOPER: Why are you telling me this? I already told you I'm not going to tell anyone about this place.\", \"CASE: I know you won't, Mr. Cooper. We're telling you this because I want you to join us.  Cooper looks at him. Is he serious?\", \"COOPER: But I don't have any of the experience. Any training. You people have been preparing for this for years.  Case shakes his head.\", \"CASE: Humans worry about things like rank and experience. I'm only concerned with whether someone would be useful.\", \"COOPER: No. I'm sorry.  Cooper is deeply conflicted.

Cooper squints -- the light is blinding. INT. GREENHOUSE, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT:  They are standing in a sealed corridor in the middle of a massive underground greenhouse. Through the glass, Cooper can see an acre or so of corn plants.  Cooper looks at the plants. They're all badly wilting.\", 'COOPER: The blight.', \"BRAND: In the last century strands were limited to one or two species. But this one targets everything. Essentially it's more efficient at consuming our food than we are.  Cooper looks at the dying corn.\", \"COOPER: But it doesn't affect the corn.\", \"BRAND: Not yet. But it will. We've grown a dozen forms of it that can. It's just a matter of time before the same ones develop out there. BRAND: (shakes her head) Who's going to find it? The universities are a joke. People like you are reduced to scavenging just to get by.\", \"COOPER: You've known this for how long? And you didn't try to tell anyone?\", \"BRAND: What would be the point? So humanity could spend the last fifty years of its life fighting over the scraps? It's better that they don't know.  Cooper begins to argue, then stops. He knows enough history to know she's right. He looks at the withering crops. BRAND: A new home for humanity. We'll set up a colony, then return to bring more people across.\", \"COOPER: But you'd still only be able to save a few hundred. Maybe a thousand.\", \"BRAND: Would it be better if we all died?  She looks him directly in the eye. EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT:  Cooper walks Murph back to the plane.  He looks back at Brand, who holds his eye for a beat, then turns back into the light of the underground facility.  Cooper buckles Murph into his seat. CUT TO:: EXT. AIRFIELD -- NIGHT:  Cooper's airplane touches down heavily on the runway. EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT:  Cooper carries his sleeping son into the house. INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT:  Donald is sitting at the kitchen table, lost in thought. Cooper has told him everything. DONALD: You get older, sometimes you just want to sit back and watch it all play out. Your life. Your kids' lives. The whole crazy story.\", \"COOPER: I can't go. I have to look after the boys.\", \"DONALD: You've been preparing these boys to be on their own since their mom died. Besides, I'll be here to look after them, same as I've always been.\", 'COOPER: I have a responsibility to them--', \"DONALD: That's right. You do. 41.  Cooper looks back out the window, thinking. The night sky is filled with stars. CUT TO:: INT. FARMHOUSE -- DAY:  Cooper, duffel slung over his shoulder, stands by the door. He gives his son, Tom, a hug. Murph is nowhere to be seen.  Cooper looks to the back of the house. INT. MURPH'S ROOM, FARMHOUSE -- DAY:  Murph is sitting at his desk, crossing out numbers on a sheet covered with math. Cooper steps inside.  He notices a packed suitcase sitting by the door. The boy looks up, hopeful. MURPH: I've been doing the math, dad. I weigh about 85 pounds. Now that's an extra ton of fuel. But if-\", 'COOPER: You have to stay here, pal.', \"COOPER: There's going to be important work to do here, too.  Tears are streaming down the boy's face. Cooper takes his watch off. Looks at it.\", \"MURPH: You're not coming back, are you?\", \"COOPER: I will come back. I promise. 42.  Murph shakes his head, but the sadness remains. He knows this is goodbye, even if his father doesn't.  Heart breaking, Cooper hugs his son and turns to the door.\", \"CUT TO:: EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY:  The Piper Cub touches down. Donald is at the controls. Cooper climbs down, pulls out his bag. Reaches back in and grips the old man's hand to say goodbye.  Cooper turns and walks toward the bunker. The doors open and Tars and Doyle step out to greet him.  Tars ushers Cooper onto the elevator.\", \"COOPER: Don't look so happy to see me.\", 'DOYLE: Tars was a Marine. They gave him a sense of humor to help him fit in with his unit better.', 'COOPER: Great idea. A massive, sarcastic robot.', \"TARS: I have a cue light I can turn on when I'm joking, if you like.  Tars points to a tiny LED over his eyebrow.\", 'COOPER: That sounds like a good idea.', \"TARS: Great. Maybe you can use it to find your way back to the ship after I blow you out the airlock.  Cooper looks at him. Tars looks back, deadpan. After a beat, the little light turns on above his right eyebrow.  The doors to the bunker begin to grind closed. 43. INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY:  Cooper walks in, still looking for a place to put his things.  Brand sees him. He smiles in greeting. She doesn't return the gesture. Instead, she holds up the telemetry board. BRAND: You don't like this one, you get to help me find a replacement.  She heads for the door. EXT. BAY, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- DAY:  Cooper is riding in a small rubber zodiac struggling to pull on a wetsuit. Brand is GUNNING the engine, guiding the tiny craft to a point in the middle of the bay.\", \"COOPER: I was wondering where you've been getting your supplies.\", \"BRAND: We knew we'd need decades of parts and materials. The government was getting rid of some things. So we arranged to take some off their hands.  She cuts the engine and hooks the boat up to a buoy. She tosses a compact rebreather.\", \"COOPER: So you're a salvage diver now? I thought you were a biologist.\", 'EXT. UNDERWATER, BAY -- DAY:  Cooper sinks underwater and begins swimming after Brand, who is descending at a rapid clip.  She pulls out a flashlight and turns it on. A tiny beam picks out details at the bottom.  Cooper stops breathing.  The bottom of the ocean is covered with an entire fleet of the US navy. Nuclear subs. Battleships. Destroyers.  Cooper remembers to breath again. Then he hurries to catch up with Brand. INT. LAUNCH TUBES, NUCLEAR SUB, UNDERWATER -- DAY:  Cooper holds the light as Brand efficiently disassembles a ballistic missile and removes the telemetry board.  She holds it up for Cooper. He nods. She swims on. INT. RESEARCH LAB, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT:  Cooper, dripping wet, holding the telemetry board, struggles to keep pace with Brand through stacks of equipment and years of research and experimentation. BRAND: You can set that down over there.  Cooper sets the board down. His eye is drawn to a bizarre experiment -- an ant colony built into a massive spinning centrifuge. Brand notices.', \"COOPER: We're taking ants with us?\", 'BRAND: Humans are also collective organisms. 45.', 'COOPER: I thought humans were more solitary.', 'COOPER: Looks like hard work.', \"BRAND: It's a paradox. Life couldn't form without gravity. No stars. No planets. The component pieces would just drift apart. But too much of it and you're trapped.  Brand's guard relaxes a tiny bit as she talks about her work. The moment passes quickly, and she continues on into the stack of equipment. INT. MISSION CONTROL, UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- NIGHT:  Cooper watches with the rest of the crew as Case pulls up the holographical maps for their journey.  Brand steps into the back of the room. Cooper notices her and nods. She ignores him. CASE: We've updated our mission parameters based on the data from the probe.  Case switches the map to a vista filled with stars and black holes. Case zooms in on the center of the hologram: an incredibly\\r bright mass with plasma jets firing off in either direction.\", \"COOPER: Is that a star?  ROTH, 50s, the crew's brilliant and blunt physicist, zooms the map in, revealing, at the center, a black heart. 46.\", \"ROTH: No. A black hole. There are several in the region, but this is the largest -- a billion times heavier than the sun. I call it Gargantua. CASE: We're headed for this smaller black hole. Roth calls it Pantagruel. We think the ice planet is here-  Case draws a finger through the air, leaving a red trail. He traces the trajectory their ship will take.\", 'COOPER: Lose time?  Roth shifts the hologram -- the stars and black holes flatten onto a sheet that bends, revealing the curvature of gravity.', 'ROTH: High speed or high gravity both slow down time, relative to earth.', 'COOPER: How much time?', \"ROTH: Based on the information from the probe -- as much as five years.  Doyle looks at the tiny ship's trajectory, threaded between two black holes. He looks worried. DOYLE: I still think we're making a lot of assumptions. About the wormhole. About the planet. (points to map) The critical orbit here is incredibly dangerous. It's like walking on the rim of the volcano. BRAND: As long as we're careful, we'll make it. DOYLE: How do you know that? BRAND: I find it hard to believe that someone would build a wormhole to a planet with water and oxygen just to lead us to a dead end. DOYLE: I thought you were a scientist, Brand. That sounds more like a hypothesis. BRAND: A guess. That's right. We don't have time to wait for conclusive proof.\", 'COOPER: Sure. Till we ran out of food and ate all of them.', \"DOYLE: What do you think, Roth?  Roth leans forward, studying the map. ROTH: If we're guessing, then I'd say Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't exist naturally. I think it's there for a reason. That someone is trying to help us.  Brand looks satisfied. DOYLE: So you think we'll have no problem navigating between two massive black holes to a tiny planet? ROTH: I think we'll probably be killed. (off his look) I said I thought there was a plan. Not that the plan was for us to find a planet like Earth to save a handful of people. DOYLE: If that's not the plan, then what are we supposed to be doing out there? 49. INT. MACHINE SHOP, UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- DAY:  Brand's Father is sitting at a desk, examining the corrupted data on the probe. Tars is helping him.  Brand's Father looks up from the screen as Cooper walks up. BRAND'S FATHER: Tars here needs to be disassembled. I figured you could do the honors.\", 'COOPER: (to Tars, sarcastic) I thought I was going to get to enjoy your company all the way to Mars.  Tars hands him a plastic waterproof case.', \"TARS: You will. My chassis is too heavy for the rocket stage. They have another one waiting for me in orbit.  Tars turns his back to Cooper. Two flaps on the back of his torso slide open, revealing his control module. BRAND'S FATHER: It's noise. I know it's noise. But it looks too orderly. Probably just an old man seeing things. 50.  He shuts down the monitor. INT. UNDERGROUND HANGAR -- DAY:  The crew file into the capsule, wearing their bulky spacesuits.  Cooper watches as Brand's Father seals his daughter into her suit. He hugs her and she heads for the capsule. INT. CONTROL CAPSULE, ROCKET -- NIGHT:  Cooper straps himself into a seat next to Brand. He catches her eye. She looks away -- she's crying.\", \"COOPER: We'll be back.  It sounds like he's trying to reassure himself as much her.\", \"BRAND: I won't.  Cooper looks at her, confused. As he does, the entire rocket SHAKES as the primary rockets begin to fire. EXT. SANTA CRUZ ISLAND -- NIGHT:  The desolate island is suddenly painted in color as the rocket lifts off on a massive white cloud. EXT. FIELD -- DAY:  Murph sits alone on a rise overlooking the massive co-op farms. Behind him the combines continue to work, oblivious.  Murph watches a tiny vapor trail as it races for the heavens. His father's watch dangles from his wrist. INT. CAPSULE -- NIGHT:  The interior of the capsule SHAKES with incredible violence as the rocket is lifted up on a giant, continuous explosion. 51. EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT:  The rocket sheds one stage, then another, until finally the naked capsule reaches the blackness of space and rockets on. INT. CAPSULE:  Cooper looks through the tiny porthole into inky blackness.  As they get closer, he makes out a looming matte black structure that passes light from the stars directly through.  In the center of the structure, Cooper can see a globe-like ship covered in the same refractive material: the ENDURANCE. INT. SPACE STATION:  The door cracks open and equalizes with a HISS. Case, more comfortable in the zero gravity environment than the humans, hauls himself through.  They are greeted by a group of robots painted in the same material as the ship -- the engineers who built and have maintained the Endurance for thirty years. INT. MACHINE SHOP, SPACE STATION:  One of the robots leads Cooper through a long lab-like room filled with machines capable of fabricating almost anything imaginable. Cooper looks like a kid in a candy store.  The robot reaches a vacuum-sealed package. Cuts it open, revealing a bipedal frame.  Cooper begins LAUGHING -- Tar's new body is beautifully designed, but tiny, only about four feet tall. ENGINEER ROBOT: Would you like me to install the chip?\", 'COOPER: Oh, no. I want to see this.  Cooper takes Tars\\'s chip out of its plastic safety case and looks it over. The engineer opens a bay in the back of the frame and Cooper slides the chip inside.  The frame begins its \"handshake\" -- lights illuminate on the body, muscles flicker from a long gestation. The eyes open.', \"TARS: I wouldn't call it that, exactly.  He reaches out an arm and pats Cooper on the shoulder. INT. ENDURANCE, SPACE STATION:  Cooper and the others haul themselves into the ship. To Cooper's surprise, it's quite compact, and divided into two chambers, like nestled spheres.\", \"COOPER: The ship is tiny.  Doyle, squeezing past him, smiles at Cooper's surprise.\", \"DOYLE: So is the wormhole.  Doyle pats Cooper on the back. Cooper begins hauling gear inside. EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT:  In complete silence, the Endurance detaches from the space station and rolls gently away.  After a moment, its nuclear engines fire and the Endurance begins to accelerate steadily away from the Earth. INT. SPACE STATION:  The engineer robots who built the Endurance watch as their creation disappears into space.  Their mission is complete. One by one, they shut down. INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE:  The crew watch through a translucent section of the ship's hull as the Earth gets steadily smaller.  Then they settle in for the long journey to the wormhole. 53. INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE:  Tars is hunched over a small communications relay, one hand is holding a paint brush -- he is making delicate strokes, painting the relay a bright blue.  Cooper watches him for a moment. Tars looks up. TARS: It's the comms relay. It will allow us to talk to earth, even on the far side of the wormhole.\", 'COOPER: I know. So why are you painting it?  Tars looks almost bashful.', 'TARS: It helps me calibrate my fine motor control.', 'COOPER: Sure it does.', 'TARS: I learned it during the war.', \"COOPER: What'd you paint?\", \"TARS: Tombstones.  Cooper watches him finish in silence. INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE:  Cooper watches a highly-compressed video of his son, Tom, talking about school. TOM: They said I can start an agriculture class a year early.  Cooper shakes his head. DONALD: I'm sorry, Coop. I asked Murph to record you a message but he's still... well, he's still angry with you. I'll try again next week.  The video cuts out. Cooper stares at the darkened screen. INT. ENGINE ROOM, ENDURANCE:  Cooper, Brand and Tars are moving the bundles of colonization equipment into bins along the wall of the craft.  Tars pulls a stack of equipment out the stack and stows it against the wall. Cooper copies the procedure.  They labor in silence, working their way along the hull. Cooper gets quicker with each bundle, keeping pace with Tars. TARS: Be careful. It's difficult to gauge mass in zero gravity.\", 'COOPER: How much do these things weigh?', 'TARS: Four tons.  Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily in his hands. He tries to stop it. Catches his hand.', 'COOPER: Damn.  He jerks his hand away, then pushes himself after the spinning bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull. Tars helps him catch it inches from the hull wall.  Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time with an exaggerated grin.', \"BRAND: Smile.  Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness.\", 'COOPER: Why?', 'BRAND: Because it lowers your blood pressure. 55.  Cooper looks at his hand. Blood is pouring out of his palm in large glistening bubbles. INT. INFIRMARY, ENDURANCE:  Cooper, slightly embarrassed, is seated while Case is hunched over his hand, sewing the meat of it back together with perfect little stitches. CASE: How are you feeling?', 'COOPER: Fine. The anesthetic is working.', 'CASE: No -- I mean how is your mood? You seem to be developing good relations with everyone on the mission. Except perhaps Ms. Brand. CASE: Only five percent of my resources are devoted to human anatomy. Ten percent is the mission protocol. The rest is human psychology.', 'COOPER: Why?', 'CASE: We are floating in a total vacuum in a plastic ship powered by nuclear engines. But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of organic material in your skull.', \"COOPER: If we're such a liability, why take us along? You and Tars could build the colony without us. You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen.\", 'CASE: Because humans, despite your obvious physical shortcomings, are better at surviving than we are. Your programming is better than ours. 56.', \"COOPER: Humans aren't programmed.  Case stops, looking Cooper in the eye.\", 'CASE: Would you prefer I was honest? These things can be uncomfortable for humans.', 'COOPER: Did they program you to be condescending?', \"CASE: Yes. Of course. CASE: Exactly. You believe it so much you won't listen to me.\", 'COOPER: How would that make us better at surviving?', 'CASE: When I die, the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own power cycle. Would you like to know the last thing you will see?  Cooper hesitates. Case senses the jump in his heart rate.', 'COOPER: No. I want to know.', 'CASE: The last thing you will see before you die will be your children. INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE:  Cooper begins recording a message. He looks unsure.', \"COOPER: We've almost reached the wormhole.\", \"INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Cooper steps out. Brand looks up at him. BRAND: We'll be able to communicate with Earth even from the far side of the wormhole.  Cooper smiles, grateful for this small kindness.\", 'COOPER: I know. Thank you.', \"BRAND: I can't imagine how tough it would be to leave your kids behind. 58.\", 'COOPER: You never had any? I thought I was a pariah for only having two.', \"BRAND: Hard to settle down when you've spent your life waiting to leave the planet.  Cooper looks at the holographic model of the black hole system. The ice planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting the smaller black hole.\", 'COOPER: Strange place to look for a new home.', \"BRAND: You wouldn't want to get too close to the surface of the sun, either. Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways.\", \"COOPER: You really think there's a plan?\", \"BRAND: I hope so. (looks at him) You don't?\", \"COOPER: I guess I just think we're on our own.  Cooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of black holes orbiting each other.\", \"EXT. LAGRANGE POINT, SPACE:  Behind the ship, the sun is a distant light, not much bigger than the other stars. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Case looks at the wormhole on the screen. It glows with the light of stars billions of light-years away. CASE: Deploy the comms relay. 59.  Cooper moves to the communications touchscreen. EXT. ENDURANCE:  The relay is released from the ship, and we finally get a look at Tars' paint job -- the stubby device looks like a 20th century mail box.  The relay drifts in space. A signal light illuminates as it sends a test packet of data to the ship. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Cooper watches the comms screen. After a moment it TONES as it receives a data packet from Earth. CASE: Everyone take their station for transit. We're heading into the wormhole mouth.  Cooper and the rest begin folding away equipment in the control room and moving into the outer layer of the ship.  Case initiates a sequence on the keypad and the nuclear engines disengage themselves from the ship. EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE:  The nuclear engines drift a safe distance back from the ship and then snap tight on their tether. INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE:  The crew move into the tight, claustrophobic outer layer of the ship. They will have very little room as the ship passes through the wormhole.  Tars detaches his legs in order to take up less space during transit. Then he tethers himself to the hull wall.  Case is the last to join them. He detaches a small control module from the console, then pulls himself into the outer hull and seals the passageway.  Case presses a button on the control module. With a GROAN, the hull walls of the ship begin to BEND. EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE:  The ship's hull begins to CRACK open, revealing the inner chamber. 60. INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE:  The SHUDDERING continues. The crew watch nervously as the control chamber below them suddenly opens itself to the cold blackness of space. EXT. ENDURANCE, SPACE:  The ship silently rolls itself into position, pointing the opening in its hull toward the wormhole mouth.  Slowly, the Endurance pushes itself forward, closer and closer to the crystal-like mouth. Finally, it envelops the mouth, bringing it into the open chamber. INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE:  As the crew watch, the wormhole mouth is positioned in the center of the inner compartment.  Case presses a sequence key on the control panel and the ship's hull closes again, trapping the wormhole inside it.  With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins contracting, squeezing itself down around the wormhole mouth.  Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship begins gently lowering itself into the wormhole mouth, feeding itself into the wormhole from the inside out. Cooper watches as Doyle is swallowed into the compressing ship with a GRUNT. TARS: Would you like me to make a joke? Cooper's turn: he is fed into the hole, legs first, then\\r waist, torso, and, finally, his head. EXT. SPACE:  The Endurance shrinks as it sinks from the inside out into the wormhole.  After a moment, it's gone. The only thing left behind is the comms relay, drifting in space, waiting for a signal. INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE:  The ship continues to slide through the wormhole. Through the outer hull they see images of themselves repeating -- a trick of the narrow collar of space they are sinking through. Cooper smiles at himself. The experience is unnerving. 61.\", 'COOPER: Where are we?', 'CASE: The hull is intact. Thirty more seconds transit.  For a moment, the ship slides gently, silently, through the wormhole. The quiet is eery.  Suddenly, a point of distortion appears in the hull next to Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull of the ship with a giant finger.', \"COOPER: Something's happening to the hull over here.\", 'CASE: Hull integrity is fine.  The distortion moves along the hull, growing in diameter.', \"COOPER: Well, I don't know what your display is telling you but something is happening over here.  Suddenly, along the hull, Doyle speaks up, panicked.\", \"DOYLE: I've got a problem over here, too.  Doyle is watching a separate distortion move across the inner wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material of the hull.  Suddenly, the point in front of Cooper detaches itself from the outer wall and moves through the space in front of him, bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind it like a sphere-shaped magnifying glass. DOYLE: What the hell are they, Case? CASE: I don't know. It could be gravitational turbulence.  The twisting sphere in front of Doyle begins to grow. DOYLE: It's getting bigger.  Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere absorbs it, twisting Doyle's hand. Doyle CRIES OUT.  His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled. But Doyle, hyperventilating, isn't in any pain. ROTH: It's not bending your hand. It's bending the space around your hand.  The sphere begins to pass through Doyle's body. Doyle is freaking out.  The sphere in front of Cooper makes contact with him, also. He holds his breath as it touches him, squeezing and distorting his body. BRAND: This isn't turbulence. Look at the way they're moving -- it's like something's examining us.  Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the length of it.\", 'COOPER: Can you ask it to stop?  Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish. For a moment, the crew is silent, still spellbound by the encounter.  An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber begins to', \"distort from a spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres\\r joined. The ship GROANS as if it's being pulled apart. ROTH: The wormhole is splitting into two paths. Radiation is pouring from one path to the other. 63.  Case stares at the controls. Decides. CASE: Release the second mouth. DOYLE: None of our testing involved opening the ship inside the wormhole. We have no idea what might happen. CASE: We're going to find out.  Doyle reaches over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a sequence.  After a moment, the hull cracks open, creating a channel through which the radiating mouth can escape.  The opening in the ship allows the pressure to begin to concentrate on one fracture point. The ship SHUDDERS as it's squeezed along its axis.  Case punches in a code and the ship begins to close again, painstakingly slowly. Finally, the ship calms as it closes around the original wormhole. EXT. WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE:  The Endurance emerges from the opposite end of the wormhole from the inside out. It drifts in space. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  For a moment, the crew are silent, taking it in. ROTH: Look at that.  Roth is looking through the translucent panel on the hull.  They are on the warped side of the universe. 64. EXT. WORMHOLE MOUTH, WARPED SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE:  The vista is dazzling -- an ocean of massive stars and black holes, some adorned with jets and brilliant gas disks.  At the center, like a king at the center of his court, is Gargantua, plasma jets spewing from its poles. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  The crew pull themselves back into the control deck from the outer hull. Their incredible surroundings are visible in all directions as Endurance passes the light into the cabin. CASE: Reconfigure the engines and test the communications array.  The crew break themselves away from the view and get to work. Roth begins adapting his models of the local system with the real observational data pouring in from the ship's instruments.  Cooper pulls himself to the comms post. PINGS the relay they left on the far side of the wormhole. EXT. WORMHOLE MOUTH 'A', SPACE:  The blue and white comms relay LIGHTS up as it receives a packet through the wormhole. INT. ENDURANCE:  After a nervous moment, the comms computer TONES with a response -- they're still in touch with the Earth.\", \"COOPER: It's working.  Tars finishes reeling the nuclear engines back in from their tether and locks them into place.  Roth's updated model appears on the monitors. Brand stares at it, startled.\", \"BRAND: We're moving. DOYLE: That's not possible. We haven't activated the engines yet.  The ship's skin illuminates, overlaying a plotted course on top of the view. 65.  They are moving, very rapidly, on a course that leads directly between the black hulks of Gargantua and Pantagruel. CASE: Roth. Why are we moving?  Roth looks at the stars, then back to his model. ROTH: The smaller black hole. We're much closer to it than the models predicted. We're being pulled by its swirl. Very quickly.  The crew looks out through the hull. They are being pulled into Pantagruel's swirl -- a glittering disc of matter spinning at high speed around the hole.  Doyle looks behind them. The wormhole mouth is rapidly growing smaller. CASE: Doyle. Fire the engines. Now.  The ship's engines FIRE, straining to fight the irresistible pull of the supermassive black hole. They won't be able to fight it for long. DOYLE: We're being pulled into it? ROTH: No. I don't think so...  Roth looks at the instrumentation for a moment. DOYLE: You don't know that.  Case stares ahead into the darkness. ROTH: We should turn off the engines. Let the swirl take us. CASE: Shut down the engines.  The engines shut down.  SILENCE. The ship drifts for a moment in the swirl, then begins to move. EXT. ENDURANCE:  The ship accelerates as it is pulled by the irresistible force of the black hole onto an inspiraling orbit. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  The crew watch as the ship hurtles around the black hole at higher and higher speeds.  The sky overhead begins to spin due to their motion -- faster and faster until it becomes a blur. The ship begins to GROAN as it appears to be pulled in two different directions.  The ship is now speeding around the black hole at incredible speed -- one revolution every four seconds. The crew are suddenly SLAMMED against the hull in opposite directions -- some towards the black hole, some towards the opposite side.  Roth looks at his model, which shows the projected path of the ship. It looks perilously close to the event horizon. ROTH: It's the tidal gravity caused by the black hole. It means we're right on the critical orbit.  The comms screen lights up, TONING again and again, as it receives a long garbled update. Then it shuts down. Cooper drags himself along the hull until he reaches the controls.\", \"COOPER: We've lost contact with the relay.  Case joins Cooper at the comms screen.  While they're distracted, Doyle maneuvers himself over to the engine control. 67.\", \"DOYLE: I'm sorry. I can't let you kill us. We have to go back.  The engines strain to fight the swirl -- but they're hopelessly outgunned by the gravity of the black hole. EXT. ENDURANCE:  Instead of reversing course, the Endurance begins to speed up, as it plummets closer and closer to the black hole. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Doyle's face sinks as he watches the controls -- on the 'volcano' model, the ship is now passing the crest and spiraling towards destruction. He has made a tragic mistake. DOYLE: Why isn't it slowing down? ROTH: We're being pulled towards the event horizon.  ALARMS begin sounding throughout the ship as the projected course on Roth's model shifts, showing the Endurance being pushed up the rim, past the critical orbit and down towards the black hole's event horizon.  Case takes control of the ship, trying to fire the engines forwards to speed them back up to safety, but it's too late. ROTH: They would if we used it all at once.  Cooper is still trying to understand what Roth means as Tars locks himself into the engine compartment. 68.\", 'COOPER: What is he doing?', \"BRAND: Saving us.  Tars tears open the engine's control panel and begins overriding it. EXT. ENDURANCE:  Tars rips out the cooling circuitry. Then, holding on tight, he fires the engine. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  The crew watch as Tars holds the engine, blasting it at full power into the swirl. The engine heats up white-hot. ROTH: Prime the remaining engine. When he detonates it, we'll only have a few seconds. If we overshoot we could be pulled into the bigger hole.  Roth moves to the controls. CASE: Secure yourselves. The ship should be able to withstand the blast.\", 'COOPER: What about Tars?  As the crew watches, Tars continues to hold the engine even as the casing around it begins to melt. Finally, it EXPLODES.', \"EXT. SPACE:  Tars is thrown backwards from the explosion, tumbling through space as the ship is ROCKETED upwards. INT. ENDURANCE:  The ship is SLAMMED by the explosion. Cooper and the rest of the crew are SMASHED against the hull. Doyle is knocked unconscious. Brand steps over to him and cradles his head, trying to protect him.  On Roth's model, the course slowly pushes outward, out of the danger zone, back to the original delicate orbit.  As they near the original orbit, Case fires the remaining engine, pushing them back onto the outspiraling orbit. 69. CASE: It's going to be close, but we're going to make it.  Brand looks at the instruments. Points to a tiny radar contact receding towards the massive black hole. BRAND: Tars. His transponder is still working.  The ship's instruments TONE every few seconds as it communicates with Tars' onboard computer. ROTH: He's being pulled toward Gargantua. We can't help him.  The crew watch, helpless, as the tones grow further and further apart. Then they stop.  Cooper looks at Doyle, anger rising. Then he looks down. EXT. SPACE AROUND PANTAGRUEL:  The Endurance slowly spirals back away from Pantagruel, the sky slowing as the orbit grows longer.  Finally, a tiny speck of light appears in front of the ship. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Roth watches as the Endurance races back away from the black hole and into a perfect orbit around a tiny ice planet.  Roth looks up from his screen, smiling. ROTH: We're here. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  As Roth and Doyle study the frozen planet below, Cooper tries in vain to signal the relay on the Earth side of the wormhole.  Brand and Case are having a private conversation away from everyone else. Cooper walks over.\", \"COOPER: I still can't contact the relay.  Brand ignores him at first. She nods at Case. 70.\", \"BRAND: I've already checked it. It's electromagnetic interference. We'll try again in a few hours.  Cooper begins to ask her what's wrong, but she moves off.  Roth looks up from his monitor, excited. ROTH: I've got a signal. But it's local.  A familiar CHIRP plays over the ship's speakers.\", 'COOPER: How could they all have landed in the same place?', \"EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET:  The ship settles into orbit a few hundred kilometers above the surface of the ice planet. It can't get any closer:\\r  The space below it is choked with hundreds of tiny moons -- a cruder version of Saturn's rings. The moons are hurtling around the planet at high speed. INT. AIRLOCK, ENDURANCE:  Brand ushers Doyle into the landing module. Cooper objects.\", \"COOPER: We're bringing him along? 71.\", \"BRAND: We need all the help we can get. Besides, the alternative is to leave him on the ship alone. You think he'll still be here when we get back?  Cooper steps aside, allowing Doyle onboard. EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET:  The lander detaches from Endurance, rolls over on its belly, and FIRES thrusters to sink towards the planet's surface. INT. LANDER:  The crew watches, fascinated, as the ship descends, navigating between the moons that hurtle past.  The moons are vastly different than our own; potato shaped and only one to two miles in circumference, they are hugged in a close embrace with the ice planet, only a few hundred thousand feet from the surface. EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  The lander touches down on the ghostly surface of the planet. EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  After a moment, the hatch HISSES open and the team steps out, led by Case, holding a rifle.  The team sets out, moving slowly in their cumbersome suits.  Lit by the nebula, the surroundings are a little brighter than a full moon on Earth.  Not that there's much to look at. They are standing on a sea of ice, which spreads for miles. In the distance, small rock formations break through the ice.  Brand takes a surface reading of the ice. CASE: The other probes should be directly beneath us.  Case and the others begin digging into the hillside. Cooper is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four feet high. He takes out a small folding shovel and begins scraping at the ice and snow.  Case hits something solid. But it's not a probe. He digs around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the hillside, revealing the outline of something metal:\\r  A door. They're not standing at the base of a hill -- it's a shelter. The crew stands back, unsure what to make of it.  A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away to reveal something flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright patch of red fabric:\\r  It's the flag of the People's Republic of China. BRAND: How could the Chinese have gotten here first? The federal government kept the wormhole a secret.  Case shrugs. He has a soldier's gallows humor about his old employer's ability to keep anything a secret. CASE: They didn't do a very good job.  Case reaches for the door of the shelter. It's sealed shut with ice. He wrenches it open. INT. CONTROL MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT:  Case steps into the shelter, followed by the rest of the crew. His lights pick up several years worth of dust.  Case steps up to an equipment locker. Forces it open. Inside are half a dozen black probes. Exposed to light, the probes begin TONING like the one Cooper found in Texas. DOYLE: The Chinese must have captured them. So they couldn't return to us.  The crew stare at the probes for a moment, taking it in. BRAND: Then how did the probe that Cooper found return? 73. ROTH: The more immediate question is what happened to the Chinese expedition. There's no sign of their ship in orbit. And they never returned to earth.  Roth picks up an ancient vacuum sealed package of pickled egg. Virtually none of the rations have been eaten. EXT. VALLEY, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Cooper and Brand scrape ice from one of the other small hills surrounding the valley, revealing another structure. Cooper forces the door open. INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Cooper and Brand let themselves in. The shelter is well stocked with food and equipment.  Brand is taking readings with a radiation detector. BRAND: The whole place has been dosed with huge levels of radiation. What happened here?  Cooper looks at the pieces of a modular, one-person rocket, a last-ditch means of escape, stored, untouched in the shelter. He steps back, realizing something.\", 'COOPER: This is the Taichung mission.', 'BRAND: The Mars mission? The Chinese claimed it had been destroyed on landing.  Cooper looks over the relay log.', \"COOPER: They never landed. Not on Mars. Four human crew, fifteen robots. The log says the base has been here for thirty years.  Case's familiar voice comes through the radio.\", \"INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT:  The structure is filled with drilling equipment. Cooper and the rest of the team stand at the edge of a three-foot hole that has been drilled into the ice.  A descending rig is anchored to the top of the hole. Doyle and Case struggle to pull themselves out of the hole. DOYLE: It goes down for a hundred and fifty feet, then stops. Tunnel's old -- the ice has reformed at the bottom. BRAND: I'm going to descend to take some samples. Cooper, want to make yourself useful?  Cooper begins to say something, then bites his tongue. EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT:  Cooper emerges, loaded down with several containers of Brand's equipment.  As he struggles through the wind and snow, his radio picks up data chatter between the mother ship and Case. The comms are just noise. After a moment, Case's voice cuts in. INT. UTILITY MODULE, CHINESE BASE CAMP -- NIGHT:  Roth and Case are looking at a portable monitor, showing a projection of the nearby system -- the ice planet is a speck orbiting the local black hole.\", 'COOPER: The entire human crew is buried out there in the snow. 75.  Roth looks up from the monitor and assesses the situation with his usual detachment.', \"ROTH: I think I know what killed them. This planet isn't the only thing orbiting this black hole.  Roth zooms the monitor in, revealing a tiny, impossibly-bright object appearing at the horizon of the black hole. BRAND: How long do we have left? ROTH: About five minutes.\", 'COOPER: Then what?', 'BRAND: Then we die. The radiation will cook us alive.  Cooper looks around, their predicament settling in. Case walks over to the edge of the mine shaft. CASE: We have to go down.', 'COOPER: What about returning to the ship?', \"BRAND: Not enough time. Case is right. The ice can shield us from some of the x-rays. DOYLE: It would take a thousand feet of ice to shield us.  Brand gives up on the argument, sheds her equipment and clips herself to the line to follow Case down into the ice.  Cooper looks at Doyle, then follows her. 76. INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- NIGHT:  Cooper descends into the shaft. The only light is from his suit's light array.  He reaches the bottom of the shaft, which opens into a small cave, the ice ribbed in wave-like patterns like the seafloor.\", 'COOPER: What is this?', \"BRAND: A pocket formed by gas. There may be more below.  The ice below them reveals nothing but murky blackness. Case has found some of the equipment left behind by the Chinese -- a battery-powered drill and a pick. DOYLE: We'll never make it far enough down. BRAND: Shut up. How much time do we have, Roth?  Roth checks his watch with his usual detachment. ROTH: About three minutes or so until we're fully exposed.  The rad meter Brand is holding begins to CHIRP with activity -- the radiation levels are rising. The ice will not be enough to protect them.  Cooper sees that Brand has exhausted herself with the pick. He takes over for her.  The drill that Case is operating GROANS as the thirty-year- old battery runs out of charge. Case casts it aside and begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand.  Brand is looking at the walls of the ice pocket, looking for fissures. Her lights pick out something in the ice. She LOOKS CLOSER::  Tiny black flecks. Brand, ever the scientist, forgets their predicament and begins chipping at the ice. BRAND: I've found something.  Case continues to pummel the ice with his hand, which is badly smashed. 77.  He pulls off the hand and continues to hack away at the ice with the stump, trying to save his crew.  Brand is examining a piece of ice in her hands, which contains several black flecks. As she shines her light on them, they FLUORESCE, giving off a tiny flicker of light, like a firefly. Brand steps back. ROTH: It's not your light they're responding to. It's this--  Roth takes the depth meter and waves it over the ice. Suddenly, the black flecks begin to shine. BRAND: X-rays. They feed on them and emit visible light. They've found a way to survive here.  Roth looks at the shimmering light of the tiny life-forms trapped in the ice, mesmerized.  Case hammers down with his arm, gouging a deep hole in the ice below. Suddenly, GAS sprays back up at him. He's found the gas pocket beneath them.  Too late. Roth's rad meter begins BEEPING frantically. EXT. ICE PLANET -- ALIEN DAWN:  Overhead, a tiny ball is orbiting into view from the dark side of the black hole -- the NEUTRON STAR.  Its humble size belies its power. As its rays hit the ice, the ice CRACKLES with energy. INT. ICE MINE SHAFT -- ALIEN DAWN:  Brand steps back from the ice in awe as it begins to glow. The microbes are absorbing the x-rays and emitting light. Within seconds, they are bathed in an incredible glow.  Even Cooper stops, awed by the beauty of the display. Only Case is unmoved, continuing to SMASH at the ice with the broken end of his wrist. 78. BRAND: (looks at rad meter) They're absorbing most of the x-rays. ROTH: Not enough, unfortunately.  Suddenly, a CRACK as Case punches into the ice. Cooper looks down -- a great fissure has opened in the ice beneath them.\", 'COOPER: Case, wait--  Case PUNCHES again. Suddenly, with a great BANG, the ice floor disintegrates beneath them.  They fall into the darkness.', 'INT. CAVERN -- ALIEN DAWN:  Cooper falls. For a moment, the only light he can see is from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him.  As they fall, the light from the microbes trapped in the ice above sweeps across the inside of the cavern, illuminating the floor of the massive cavern thousands of feet down.  The rock formations they saw on the surface are actually the tip of a mountain range extending into the distance, disappearing into the ice above as if it were cloud cover.  The base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like foliage that runs into a perfectly-still inland sea. On the far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into the distance, supporting the thick ice and rock cavern roof.  Cooper only has a few seconds to take this in -- he is falling towards the huge inland sea below.  Seconds before impact, a tiny warning light flickers on inside his helmet: IMPACT DETECTED.\\r  Suddenly, a small drag chute EXPLODES from a panel on the back of suit, slowing his fall. Airbags EXPLODE on his legs and torso to cushion the impact.  Cooper SMASHES into the water. BLACKNESS.: EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY:  Cooper comes to underwater, as liquid is flowing into his suit from his shattered helmet. 79.  Bubbles pour out from his suit and Cooper GASPS as his helmet fills with water and he begins to sink.  As he sinks, Cooper pulls off his helmet, then tears off pieces of his suit. He forces himself through the neck of the suit and then swims upward.  He is about to surface when he remembers where he is. He hesitates, just beneath the surface, lungs tightening as he runs out of oxygen. EXT. SEA, ICE PLANET -- DAY:  Cooper breaks the surface, COUGHS out water, and takes a panicked breath.  He waits. Nothing happens. He opens his mouth again and breathes in almost pure oxygen. He can breathe.  Treading water, he looks around. Spots lights in the water below nearby -- Brand, in her suit, is sinking.  He dives down and struggles to haul her up by the suit.  Cooper breaks the surface, looks at Brand. Her mask is also broken.', 'COOPER: Breathe. Trust me.  She refuses at first. Water is bubbling into her suit through the open mask. Finally, she takes a deep breath.', \"BRAND: What do you mean, you're going to let go?\", 'COOPER: Take a deep breath.  Brand takes a deep breath and Cooper lets go of her.', \"EXT. UNDERWATER -- DAY:  Brand sinks. Cooper swims down, following her, ripping away at her suit. The tear-away seals on her suit are stuck fast, damaged in the fall. 80.  Cooper finally breaks them off. Brand pulls herself out, free, and they swim for the surface. EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY:  Cooper drags himself out of the water and onto the beach. He turns back to offer Brand a hand. She waves him off. BRAND: I don't need your help.\", 'COOPER: I thought we were supposed to be a collective organism.  She gives up and lets him help her out of the water.  They sit together, soaking wet, trying to catch their breath.', 'BRAND: Thank you.', \"COOPER: Don't mention it.  Cooper feels the rocks beneath him, which are translucent, like glass, and polished to an impossible shine.  He looks up to see Case dragging Roth and Doyle, still in their suits, out of the water.\", 'EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY:  Doyle and Roth have stripped down from their suits and are breathing in the pure oxygen atmosphere.  Case and Cooper are pulling modular pieces from their equipment packs to form a small shelter.  Brand is taking readings with her instruments. BRAND: Oxygen atmosphere. Pure water. Temperate climate.', \"COOPER: Looks like we can climb up the mountains back to the ice. We're down to three suits. We'll have to send someone ahead to get a fourth. 81.\", \"BRAND: I won't need one. DOYLE: Why not? BRAND: Because I'm not going anywhere. This is our new home.  Brand picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and hikes into the jungle. EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- DAY:  Cooper finishes constructing the modest shelter. They load the suits and the rest of their gear inside.\", 'COOPER: Any sign of Brand?', \"ROTH: She's still taking samples. If you find her, tell her to head back. Night should be falling soon.\", 'COOPER: What happens then?', 'ROTH: Your guess is as good as mine.  Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand. EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- DAY:  Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like life- forms, which are wildly different from their counterparts back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a struggle to punch through the canopy to reach the light above. BRAND: This is incredible. The organisms trapped in the ice above absorb x- rays and emit light. In return, these plants absorb the light and emit oxygen, which feeds the animals trapped in the ice.  Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case. The transparent wall of the case magnifies the structure onto the glass automatically. She compares it with the flecks she collected in the ice above, fascinated. 82.', 'COOPER: Any sign of big life-forms?', \"BRAND: The soil's been disturbed. So something's been moving. But I haven't seen anything. (notices his look) Cooper... are you nervous?  Cooper stops scanning the trees, embarrassed.\", 'COOPER: I just think we should get back to the shelter before night falls.  Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the neutron star must have orbited out of view. Night is falling.', \"COOPER: You don't know that. You just have blind faith this place is going to be some kind of Eden.  Brand stops. He's struck a nerve.\", \"BRAND: (truly pissed off) Faith has nothing to do with it. You know what you are, Cooper? You're just another in a long line of people saying 'no.' That this isn't going to work. And frankly, I don't have to convince you. 83.\", \"COOPER: What's that supposed to mean?\", \"BRAND: You're on this mission because you're another pair of hands. You want the truth? I told Case we should bring another robot over you. At least then I could just reprogram you to-  She stops. Something has caught her attention.\", 'COOPER: What?', \"BRAND: Nothing. I just -- I could have sworn it just moved.  She walks to the thick, knotted trunk of a tree. Puts a hand on it.  Overhead, the ice flickers out and the darkness begins to descend, more rapidly than on Earth.  Suddenly, the tree SHUDDERS. Then, the bark begins to ooze over Brand's fingers.  Brand snaps her hand away and steps back. Even for her, this is too much. She turns back to Cooper, who is looking at the jungle around them, spooked.\", \"COOPER: You know how plants don't usually move? Is that a universal rule?\", \"BRAND: No. There really aren't any rules.  All around them, the life-forms begins to melt toward the ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.\", 'COOPER: Hello there.  The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then its head splits open and it BELLOWS.', \"EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT:  Cooper and Brand smash headlong through the jungle. At first, they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind them. But as they run, the entire jungle around them begins to break apart and move.  After a moment, they're surrounded. The jungle is completely disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each one a different size and shape than the others.\", 'COOPER: We have to reach the shelter.  They head off, crashing through the melee.', \"EXT. SHORE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Case, Doyle and Roth are standing in front of the shelter finishing the day's work.  Doyle turns around. The jungle is breaking apart and crawling down the beach towards them. DOYLE: I think we've got a problem.  Case and Roth look up to see the organisms picking up speed as they move towards them.  Roth begins to step out towards them. 85. ROTH: Fascinating. I think-  Case grabs him by the arm and pushes him bodily into the shelter after Doyle.  Case pushes the door closed. INT. SHELTER, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  They crouch inside the shelter as the organisms begin POUNDING at the walls, trying to force their way inside.  It's going to be a long night. EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Ahead, Cooper can see the gleaming water of the inland sea, light still flickering in patches from the ice above it.\", 'COOPER: This way.  Brand begins to follow.', 'BRAND: No... wait.  Too late. Cooper forces his way between two writhing creatures, steps through, and falls... EXT. WATERFALL -- NIGHT:  Cooper gasps as he surfaces from the ice-cold water. Brand floats past.  The river appears to flow randomly down the slope, with good reason -- the forest rearranges itself every night.  Ahead, the ground drops away again and the water rushes over it in a torrent.  Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick tree branch with one hand and, a second later, Brand with the other as she slides past.', \"COOPER: I've got you.  Suddenly, the branch in Cooper's hand illuminates and wrenches itself out of the rock -- it's a limb of a huge colony organism. It shakes Cooper loose and they fall again... 86.\", \"EXT. POOL -- NIGHT:  Brand surfaces first. She grabs Cooper and hauls him up and out of the water. She smiles down at him, a little smug. BRAND: I've got you.  Creatures begin splashing down into the pool behind them, as if imitating them.  Cooper stumbles to his feet and Brand guides them backward into a small cave carved into the rock above the pool. INT. CAVE -- NIGHT:  Brand CRACKS a glow stick, basking the cave around them in a soft light.  As they watch, horrified, the pool and the rocks in front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble down the hill in what appears to be a battle royal.  For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed. Then, a three-foot-tall creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave. Another follows, and another, until the cave entrance is full.  Cooper looks around the cave, frantic. He picks up a rock. Brand, scared but still thinking, takes the rock from his hand and drops it back to the ground. BRAND: It's game theory. The best move is always to cooperate at first.\", 'COOPER: By \"cooperate\" do you mean let it eat me?', 'BRAND: These organisms have no interest in us. They survive by photosynthesis. All they need is light.', 'COOPER: Then why are they killing each other?', \"BRAND: I don't know.\", 'COOPER: (trying to be calm) What is it doing?', \"BRAND: It's a colony organism. It's trying to incorporate you into its structure.\", \"COOPER: I don't want it to incorporate me.\", \"BRAND: Don't open your mouth. WHY N-:  As he speaks, the creature on his chest extends four spindly, pointed feelers and reaches gently into his mouth.  Cooper holds his breath as the organism taps against his teeth. Its skin has a roughened texture, as if incomplete, and it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much luck.  Bored, the life-forms climb back down off of Cooper. The last two creatures link up in an imitation of Cooper's lower body and attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures tumble to the ground and flail away.  Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he and Brand are left alone again.  Brand steps to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated, as the creatures resume wrestling and battling each other. BRAND: No. They don't bleed... they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking for the best one. 88.  Cooper watches as a hideously-awkward-looking, five-legged beast stumbles past and tackles another animal.\", \"COOPER: I'd say they have a long way to go.\", 'COOPER: But what are they competing for?', \"BRAND: I don't know.  Brand shivers -- it's getting colder. INT. CAVE -- NIGHT:  Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've brought with them.  Brand looks at the sample of the fractal wildlife in her case. It's moving around, splitting apart, reforming, trying to find a way out. 89. BRAND: These creatures are billions of years older than we are. But they're relatively primitive. They haven't developed tools, culture, language.\", 'COOPER: Why not?', \"BRAND: I don't know. No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. But the surface of this planet has virtually no craters. No impacts. It's been sheltered by the local black holes.\", 'COOPER: What difference would that make?', \"BRAND: Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. Maybe bad luck is the key to intelligent life. BRAND: Exactly. Maybe our interaction with them will push them over the top. Maybe that's part of the plan.\", 'COOPER: (shakes his head) The plan.', 'BRAND: Why is it so hard for you to accept that someone might be trying to help us?  Cooper is silent for a moment. His mood darkens.', 'COOPER: I was in Denver during the first year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help us. People starved to death sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come.', \"EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT:  Cooper sleeps. After a moment, Brand steps back out into the darkness. EXT. PLAIN -- DAWN:  Brand exhales great streams of frosted breath -- the temperature is well below freezing. The first flickers of light are visible in the ice above.  The creatures are huge now, forty or fifty feet tall, battling each other more and more slowly. As Brand watches, the largest of them beats down his rivals, climbing to the top of the heap.  Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck.  Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter.  Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes to catch the light. This is what the contest has been about -- a better place in the sun.  Brand takes it in. EXT. JUNGLE -- DAY:  Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage, which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. Cooper looks at the plants, wary.  Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him. BRAND: They're not going to move now, Cooper. They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light. 91.  Cooper leads the way, pushing through the trees.  Suddenly he stops again. Brand, annoyed, pushes through the foliage to join him. INT. CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY:  Massive blast doors, long since smashed in, open onto a building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife.  Case steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. Cooper and the others follow him in. INT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY:  The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has covered the tables and chairs. Water pools on the floor and light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals have punched in the ceiling. DOYLE: Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals.\", 'COOPER: Looks like they lost.  They continue through the ruins.', 'INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY:  The deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find. The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds, waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter. DOYLE: Look at the size of this place. They built it for thousands of people. But no one came.  Brand looks around, determined. BRAND: They will. We can salvage it. This place will save us years. 92.', \"COOPER: But why didn't they come?\", 'INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY:  A massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive complex of underground laboratories. INT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY:  Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs, nothing. The only thing that remains is a solid ball of matter in the center of the room. BRAND: What happened here?  Roth stares at the ball, intrigued. ROTH: They were testing something.  Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards.', 'COOPER: Testing what?  Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built from layers of different material. The outermost layer is flattened steel.', 'INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT:  The lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a pedestal in the center of the room. A black box is set into a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel.  Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the center of the room.', 'COOPER: Everything in here is bolted down.

STAIRWELL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY:  Cooper follows Brand's voice down the stairs to a sub-basement beneath the lab level. INT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY:  Cooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect holographic representation of the local system.  Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the incredibly detailed models of each star.  Case is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's records. CASE: I've found the Chinese mission logs. They're encrypted.  Cooper walks over. Looks over the terminal. 94.\", \"COOPER: Old military-grade encryption. It's not very robust. (looks at Case) No offense. Hang on.  Cooper punches a few keys into the terminal. Opens up the terminal. Scans the motherboard. Takes Case's rifle and SMASHES one of the chips on the board.  The terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle.\", \"CASE: They got here twenty years ago. The human crew was killed by radiation the first day. But the robots survived. They built the colony and radioed home. But they didn't receive a response.\", 'COOPER: No one was listening.', \"DOYLE: What problem? CASE: It doesn't say. Their science team took the ship to continue exploring the system. It says they found some kind of... BRAND: Where did they go? CASE: I don't know. They've deleted their mission plan. There's nothing else. DOYLE: I think I know what the problem is.  Doyle is manipulating the time component of the map, slowing down the passage of time, reversing it, speeding it up.\", 'COOPER: How long does this place have?', \"CASE: A few years. A decade at most.  Doyle turns to Brand. DOYLE: So much for the plan.  Cooper looks at Brand. She is in disbelief, staring as a lifetime's training and optimism are torn to pieces. 96. BRAND: But I don't understand... why are we here? What are we here for?  Cooper looks down. Brand's upset is turning to anger. CASE: It's nighttime. The native life- forms are mobile again.  The RUMBLE grows more intense, as if the entire building is being gently shaken.\", \"COOPER: No. It's closer than that.\", \"DOYLE: What the hell is happening?  Case doesn't answer -- he's looking up at the control equipment for the holographic display, which is GROANING under a load it was never built to handle.  Case grabs Cooper and Brand and pushes them towards the stairwell as the control panel TEARS free of the floor and CRASHES towards them.  Cooper falls into the stairwell -- now they're being pulled up and sideways through the stairwell, like an Escher painting.  Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris from the control panel orbits past them back up towards the lab.  They try to hang on but the force is becoming irresistible, dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards the lab upstairs.  Brand wedges herself against the railing as objects and debris are SMASHING against the door to the lab.  Doyle is trying to hang onto the handrail but his grip slips and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the door to the lab, SMASHING it open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab.  Cooper slips trying to help Doyle. Brand reaches out for him...  Too late. Cooper is pulled through the open door. INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT:  Cooper is pulled through the door and past the control panel. He reaches out and grabs the underside of the panel.  He dangles, the panel cutting into the meat of his hand, trying to get his bearings:\\r  Roth, Doyle, and everything that hasn't been bolted down is either pressed against the sphere in the center of the room or is orbiting around it. Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him: ROTH: The control panel is beneath you. See if you can turn it off. 98.  Cooper slips as he tries to reach the controls. Finally he finds the controls for the machine. INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT:  Roth, back on terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box he's pried from the center of the sphere. Cooper is looking over his shoulder.\", 'COOPER: They found a way to make gravity.', 'ROTH: Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it up, or down. I think they were experimenting with it -- firing these into the black hole to try to save this planet. DOYLE: All that from one tiny box.  Roth has hooked the box up to a terminal and it scrolling through the incredibly sophisticated machine code, trying to parse how it works. Cooper looks on.', 'COOPER: What does that mean? 99.', \"ROTH: It means whoever built the wormhole probably doesn't exist inside our universe.  Cooper looks at the tiny box.\", 'COOPER: But how did the Chinese develop the technology? This would take decades, maybe hundreds of years, to create.', \"CASE: Wherever they went, they found something that allowed them to build it.  Brand looks at the box. ROTH: They came back here and tried to use these devices to save this planet. But they didn't work. Nothing would be strong enough to weaken a black hole. BRAND: Maybe we could work with it. Try to improve it. ROTH: No. You're missing the bigger picture. The robots had strict mission parameters. They were told to build a colony and report back. They tried to. But they failed. Like us they were fixated on this place.  Cooper looks at Brand. BRAND: And go where? ROTH: Wherever we want. We don't belong in any one place. Can't you see that now? Not Earth. Not this place. Nowhere. If the human race is going to survive, we need to keep moving. Split up. Spread out. Fly. With this, we can.  Case looks at the box. Makes a decision. CASE: In the morning we're taking this and going home.  Doyle, Roth and Case set about making preparations to leave -- gathering space suits, equipment.  In the bustle, Cooper finds Brand sitting alone, staring at the sample of fractal life.\", \"COOPER: I know this isn't exactly what you trained for. But I think Roth might be right.\", \"BRAND: That doesn't help this planet. This creature is doomed. Unlike us it doesn't have anywhere to go.  The fractal organism almost seems to be looking at her, trying to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back to breaking itself into pieces and reforming into different shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down. CUT TO:: INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY:  Morning. Cooper and the others prepare to head out. They are laden down with gear -- space suits for the return trip to the lander once they reach the surface. 101.  Roth carries the gravitational prototype. EXT. ENTRANCE, CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY:  They make their way through the ruined entrance. CASE: We need to hurry. We only have a few hours to reach the ice before nightfall.  Cooper stops. He puts a hand on Brand's shoulder. He points to the tree line. Something is moving.\", \"COOPER: Don't make any sudden movements. They can't hurt us if we're unarmed.\", \"BRAND: Who?  Suddenly, three ROBOT MARINES step out of the jungle, weapons raised. They are wearing ghillie suits, pieced together from dried dead pieces of the local foliage.  Under their camouflage, they looks identical to Case. With one key difference -- faded red and gold insignias.  Case steps protectively in front of his team.  The CHINESE OFFICER steps forward, rifle levelled. CHINESE OFFICER: Ni Hao. My name is Technical Sergeant Liu, 177th reconnaissance Marines, Army of the People's Republic. Welcome to New China. CASE: This is a scientific expedition, not a military one. We are making our way back to our ship. LIU: I'm afraid I cannot let you do that. We will provide food and shelter and await further instructions. BRAND: This planet is being pulled into the black hole. We all need to leave. LIU: We will await further orders.\", \"COOPER: Further orders aren't coming. Your government is gone. It ran out of money, same as ours. You're on your own.\", \"LIU: We can offer you food and shelter as long as you require. The facilities here are quite comfortable.  Liu's tone remains polite, but there's no hope of changing his mind. Cooper takes a sidelong glance at Brand. LIU: Our mission was to prepare for the evacuation. This site was deemed unacceptable. BRAND: This device that you have built -- this could save millions of people. We need to get it back home.  Brand points to the device Roth is holding. The Chinese robots seem particularly unhappy with this development. LIU: These technologies are the property of the People's Republic. ROTH: Following? Following where?  Liu pauses. LIU: We will await further orders. ROTH: Your name means six. Where did the others go? One through five? Is that who were not supposed to follow.  Case turns to look at Cooper.\", 'COOPER: Come on.  Cooper picks up the rifle from the destroyed marine and begins hiking up the mountain.', \"EXT. MOUNTAIN PEAK -- DAY:  The crew hike towards the ice above.  Below they hear a metallic BOOM as something heavy hits something else -- Case is still fighting. They keep moving. EXT. UPPER MOUNTAIN PEAK -- TWILIGHT:  They are high above the Marine camp, only fifty feet or so below the massive ice roof of the cavern. The Chinese have blasted a tunnel into the ice leading back up to the camp above. 104.  This high, the air is bitterly cold. Cooper and the others are hunkered down, trying to keep warm, waiting for night to fall so that they can climb back up to the lander without being cooked by the neutron star.  Finally, above them, the light begins to flicker out. The crew begin pulling on their space suits.  Brand checks on the fractal wildlife in the sample case -- she is bringing it with them. Cooper catches her eye. BRAND: We can't leave them all to die.  She hefts the case and they begin climbing up into the ice. EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Brand leads the way, the lights from her suit cutting into the drifts of snow as they make their way slowly back to the lander.  As they reach the lander Cooper spots lights emerging from the ship. He raises Case's weapon.  One of Liu's marines steps around from the back of the lander. Cooper FIRES.  The marine collapses.  Cooper and the others race to the lander. BRAND: Was that the last of them? DOYLE: We're not going to stick around to count them. Let's get out of here.\", \"COOPER: We're too late.  Cooper points to a damaged section of the ship's hull -- the marine has torn open a section, revealing damaged hardware.\", \"DOYLE: What about the escape rocket at the Chinese base camp? One of us could fit into it. 105. BRAND: It doesn't matter how many of us make it. We have to get this back to earth.  Roth looks at the moons orbiting overhead. ROTH: Can the secondary thrusters still fire on the lander?  Doyle looks over the craft. DOYLE: Sure. But we don't have nearly enough power for lift off.  Roth holds up the small gravity black box. EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Cooper drags the pieces of the escape rocket out from the shelter. Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the pieces up and they snap together, forming a crude two-stage rocket designed more for a robot than a man.  When it's complete Roth wedges himself inside, clutching the black box -- he barely fits. ROTH: I can reach one of the moons in low orbit and turn up its gravity. As it passes overhead it should be able to slingshot the lander away from the planet's surface.\", 'COOPER: But we need to take the box back to earth.', \"ROTH: You don't need this -- only the idea. The knowledge of how to build it.  Cooper remembers something. Heads back into the shelter. 106. INT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Roth follows Cooper into the lab.  Cooper opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at random. Sets it down on the bench next to Roth.  Cooper begins rigging up a connection between the two.\", \"COOPER: I'm going to image the operating code and the architecture onto the probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled, but it should give you and me enough to rebuild it when we get back.  Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data.\", \"ROTH: Not me. But you'll make it work.  The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the probe, and takes the black box himself. EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Roth squeezes himself into the rocket, hugging the black box to his chest. Cooper and Brand help him. BRAND: This isn't right, Roth. We can find a way for all of us to leave. ROTH: This is the only way. Keep the lander upright and fire the secondary boosters when the moon passes overhead.\", 'COOPER: Let me take it.', \"ROTH: No. You need to make it home. You're going to need to build more of these.  Brand looks at him, heartbroken. Roth smiles. 107. ROTH: Go.  Brand turns to follow Cooper back.  Behind her, Roth's rocket LAUNCHES on an explosive cloud. In seconds it's high overhead. EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT:  Cooper checks over the hull, which is intact. Doyle is inside looking over the controls. He steps back outside. DOYLE: Control systems inside are online.\", \"COOPER: We're going to find out soon enough.  Brand is looking off into the distance.\", \"BRAND: Someone's coming.  Cooper looks up. A robotlike figure is limping through the snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle.  Finally he makes out the insignia -- it's Case.  Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as he collapses in the snow. He's badly injured -- one leg torn off at the knee, one arm mangled.  Doyle and Cooper drag the crippled robot back into the ship. INT. LANDER -- NIGHT:  They drag Case into the lander. Doyle checks over the ship's controls. 108. DOYLE: Close the door.  Cooper moves to the door. Something's wrong.\", \"COOPER: Where's Brand?  She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks out onto the ice. Brand is heading back out into the snow.\", \"EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET:  The rocket tucks in close behind one of the moons orbiting the ice planet.  The rocket fires to maneuver closer and closer to the moon's surface -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to attract it.  When the rocket is close enough, Roth detonates the explosive bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's surface.  He scrambles to grab hold of the craggy surface. Behind him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface.  Roth finally gets a good hold. He looks down.  Below him, the view is incredible -- the ice planet curving into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon.  Roth looks at the black box in his hands. EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Brand is a hundred yards from the lander by the time Cooper catches up with her. She is digging in the snow.  He takes her arm but she won't go.  She finally finds what she's looking for -- the sample case. The tiny fractal life-form is huddled at the bottom.  Cooper shakes his head and turns back to the lander. 109. EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET:  Roth is watching the ice planet pass by beneath him. He finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it punctures the ice near the Chinese camp.  For a moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of Gargantua rising over the horizon of the shining ice planet.  He takes a final breath and activates the black box.  Instantly, the moon's gravity is magnified a hundred million times over. Roth is instantly crushed as the moon collapses around him into a tiny sphere. EXT. SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Cooper and Brand are only thirty yards or so from the lander.  Suddenly, the ground beneath them begins to RUMBLE.  Cooper turns back. A mile back the ground begins to tear apart, heaving massive chunks of ice and rock into the sky.  Roth's moon is racing overhead, TEARING up a massive strip of the surface's planet as it nears them.  Cooper and Brand run. EXT. MOON, SPACE OVER ICE PLANET:  The energy being unleashed by the tiny box is incredible -- millions of times more powerful than an atomic bomb.  The spray of debris is forming a rooster tail behind the moon, rocketing up from the planet's surface. EXT. LANDER, SURFACE, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT:  Cooper has almost made it back to the lander. Behind him, Brand stumbles. He turns back.  Brand is pulling herself up. Behind her, the THUNDEROUS EXPLOSIONS as a strip of the planet's surface is hurled into space have almost reached them.  Cooper looks at the ship. He'll never make it if he waits for Brand. He turns back to find her.  He reaches Brand just as the moon's gravity hits them -- they're hurtled off into space. He grabs her hand.  Seconds later, everything -- the entire ice sheet, the sea and rocks deep below -- is hurled up after them. 110.  Brand and Cooper embrace as they rocket up through the thin atmosphere.  Brand looks at him. BRAND: Between you and utter solitude, Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure.  They reach the apex of their climb and the gravity of the planet begins to win out. For a moment they float.\", \"COOPER: Guess you were right -- too much gravity, or not enough.  He smiles, forgetting their predicament for a moment. They stare into each other's eyes.  Then they begin, very gently, to fall back towards the ice planet.  Suddenly, the lander maneuvers beneath them. The airlock opens to catch them -- Doyle is at the helm.  Brand and Cooper pull themselves aboard.\", \"INT. LANDER:  Cooper closes the door and Doyle rotates the lander outwards.  Doyle FIRES the engines and the lander continues ascending into space as the debris around them begins crashing back down towards the ice planet. Cooper looks out the window:\\r 111.  The moon continues tearing up a massive canyon in the planet's surface as it circles out of view.\", 'COOPER: Roth.', \"BRAND: He's gone. Ahead, a shadow looms in the darkness: the Endurance. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Brand, Cooper, and Doyle pull themselves out of the airlock and scramble to take control of the ship.  Below them, the surface of the ice planet illuminates as the neutron star's x-rays begin to reach it from the far side of Pantagruel.  Doyle finally gets the ship straightened out. Its sole remaining engine FIRES, rocketing the ship back towards the dark side of the planet, out of view of the neutron star, and back towards the original wormhole. DOYLE: I'm setting a course for the wormhole.  They're going to make it.  Cooper and Brand make eye contact -- Brand gives him a tiny awkward smile. He returns it, then descends below. INT. OUTER HULL, ENDURANCE:  Cooper props Case up against the workbench. He pulls down replacement arms and legs from storage bins. Unwraps them from their vacuum sealed plastic and bolts them back onto Case's chassis.  Cooper finishes attaching the arm. Case rotates it, checking the function.\", 'COOPER: How is that working?', 'CASE: Very well, thank you.', \"COOPER: Good. We've already set the course, skipper. We're going home.  Cooper hauls himself back up into the observation level. 112.\", \"INT. OBSERVATION LEVEL:  Doyle is setting the controls. The ALARMS on the controls have finally abated -- they're out of the danger zone. BRAND: We're safe now.  Cooper heads to the communications equipment.\", \"COOPER: Now I know why we weren't able to hit the relay. It's not interference -- the blue-shift from the black hole is more than we thought it would be.  Cooper begins re-calibrating the equipment.\", 'COOPER: Nothing.', 'COOPER: How much?', \"BRAND: A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if WE DON'T-:  The comms equipment TONES as it translates a packet. Then another. 113.  Then a FLOOD of communications, one packet a day, hundreds and hundreds of packets: images, videos, audio messages from\\r family and friends.  Cooper watches, horrified, as the images play out across the screen. He is watching the lives of his family play out at light speed. Finally, the packets slow, then stop.  Cooper looks at the results, in shock.\", 'COOPER: Forty seven years.  Doyle joins him, staring at the screen, stunned.', 'DOYLE: My kids...  Cooper tries to PING the relay again. Nothing comes back.', 'COOPER: We could bypass the relay. Send a conventional shortwave signal.', 'BRAND: Only a tiny portion of the signal would make it though the wormhole. Besides, no one will be listening anymore.  The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing.  Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something.', \"COOPER: You knew, didn't you? You and Case figured it out when we landed.  Brand looks down.\", \"BRAND: I thought... I couldn't be sure.\", \"COOPER: Sure you could. You're brilliant. You know everything. 114.\", \"BRAND: Cooper... we needed to keep going. I'm so sorry. Your children...\", \"COOPER: They're not children any more... if they're even still alive.  He turns away from her.\", \"BRAND: Listen, the important thing is that we're going home, now. And we have something that can save everyone. It's more important than the people we left behind-  Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger. DOYLE: That's easy for you to say. You didn't leave anyone behind.  Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness.\", 'COOPER: Yes she did.  Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness.', \"BRAND: He's gone. But there are other people who still need our help. There's still time... The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn:\\r  Case is standing at the controls. module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong:\\r  It's red with a gold star. It's not Case at all. It's Liu. LIU: I'm sorry. I have my orders. No one follows...  Liu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from the ship and back down toward Pantagruel.  Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the ground, the fight gone out of him.  Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for his control module. The instruments TONE, alerting the crew to their position:\\r  The ship is spinning back down towards the black hole. BRAND: No... We're being pulled back to Pantagruel.  Cooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining boosters.\", \"COOPER: We can't let that happen. We'll lose more time... too much...  The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black hole below them.  On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit.  As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks -- time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the deep gravity well around the hole.  As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the system above them. They watch as the ice planet whirls around them, orbiting the black hole dozens of times. 116.\", \"prepared them for the reality:\\r  The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence.  Brand looks at the sample of fractal life. Now they are united -- they are, in all likelihood, the sole survivors of their planet.  Doyle points to the instruments. DOYLE: The wormhole. Look -- it's being pulled into the black hole as well.  They watch on the holographic model as the wormhole's orbit converges on the event horizon of the black hole. BRAND: It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's.\", 'COOPER: What will happen to it?', \"BRAND: It'll be destroyed, like everything else.  Cooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications screen. Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast. Brand opens her mouth to point out that it's futile, then stops.

In silence, they watch as the wormhole -- their only way home -- vanishes beneath the event horizon.

As Doyle watches the controls the ship continues to spiral towards the black hole.', \"DOYLE: This is it. We're going to be pulled in.  Cooper looks at the controls, an idea forming.  He pulls himself down. Hauls himself across the deck to pick up Liu's chip. He plugs it into a diagnostic tool. BRAND: What are you doing?\", 'COOPER: Case said the Chinese found something else. The location was scrubbed from their records. But I bet he knows it.  Cooper fires up the chip. Begins sorting through the onboard memory.  Doyle watches the instruments.', 'DOYLE: Hurry up.  Cooper concentrates, poring over the numbers. Finally he begins feeding coordinates into the navigation computer.', 'COOPER: Here. Can we reach it?  Brand looks at the map. The point appears on the far side of Gargantua. Brand studies the trajectory.', \"BRAND: We can use the thrusters to keep us on the critical orbit. Then slingshot us towards Gargantua.  The thrusters STRAIN to push the ship back up towards the critical orbit. 118.  Suddenly, the tidal gravity SLAMS them against the walls of the ship.  Finally, the thrusters fire again -- a tiny push, but just enough to launch the ship clear of the black hole, like a rock out of a slingshot. The ship races toward the massive hole in the sky below them: GARGANTUA: EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA:  The ship picks up more and more speed as it soars closer to the massive black hole's event horizon. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  The sky closes to a tiny hole above them. Gargantua is swallowing their view.  Cooper looks at the radar, which is choked with debris. DOYLE: We only have a few minutes before we're swallowed into that thing. What are we even looking for?  On the radar, a tiny empty spot appears.\", 'COOPER: (points to screen) That? What is it?  Brand looks. In one tiny region on the back side of the black hole, the debris simply seems to vanish.', \"BRAND: It's another wormhole.  Doyle FIRES the thrusters again, pushing the ship towards the wormhole. EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA:  The Endurance spins, shifting paths slightly as it continues to race closer and closer to oblivion. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  They study the controls. The projected path shifts, one degree at a time. Finally, it appears to put them on a path to hit the wormhole.  Doyle shuts off the thrusters. 119. DOYLE: We're not going to be able to slow down. Hold onto something.  He locks up the controls. EXT. SPACE AROUND GARGANTUA -- MORNING:  The ship is tumbling through space, racing toward the second wormhole. It is massive, much larger than the first wormhole, and it's glowing with a light as bright as a star. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  The crew brace themselves against the hull of the ship.  Suddenly the ship slams onto the wormhole mouth and is pulled violently into the wormhole. WHITENESS.:  As the light fades, Cooper and the others come to.  The light is rapidly dimming from pure white, fading to a deep red, then infrared, finally darkness.  Cooper looks out. Checks the instruments. Looks out again. EXT. VACUUM:  Nothing. Blackness as far as the eye can see. No stars. No planets. Just inky darkness stretching on forever. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Brand joins Cooper on the deck. Together, they look out at the blackness that surrounds them.\", 'COOPER: Where are we?', 'BRAND: I don\\'t know. It\\'s like we entered the wormhole and never left it.  Brand checks the instruments. There is nothing for the ship to model.  There is nowhere to go. They drift. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Days go by. They check the instruments. Still nothing. It\\'s as if they have left the known universe altogether. 120. INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE:  Doyle sits down. After a moment, he turns on the screen and cues up a message.  His children appear on-screen, giggling, pushing each other, trying to get a prime spot in front of the camera.  Doyle cups his face in his hands and cries. INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE:  Cooper above his bunk, stares out into the blackness.  Brand watches him from the doorway. BRAND: I\\'m sorry. I should have told you. I didn\\'t have the right. INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE:  Brand watches her father talking to her on-screen. He is twenty years older than when she left him. BRAND\\'S FATHER: I\\'m not going to make it much longer. The machines will continue to maintain the station as long as they can and the communications will run as long as the station here still has power. I\\'m sorry. I hope wherever you are, darling, you\\'re safe.  The screen cuts out. Brand watches the static play out. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Doyle sits at the table. He has found a flair gun in one of the ditch kits. It is sitting on the table in front of him. The message is clear.  Brand sits down across from him. BRAND: Our last trip past the black hole cost us another 100, maybe 200 years. Which means there\\'s a good chance we\\'re the only humans alive anywhere. 121.  She stands up. EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM:  Cooper, in a space suit, steps out of the airlock.  He drifts out from the ship.  Nothing. Behind him, the ship is a tiny speck in an ocean of darkness. INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE:  Cooper sits down. Turns on the screen.  After a moment, the camera turns on. Tom, his eldest son, still 15 years old, turns on the camera. TOM: Hi, Dad.  Cooper pauses it. He can\\'t take it. After a moment, he lets it run again. INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE:  Cooper is holed up, still watching, several days\\' growth of beard unshaved. He\\'s been watching for days.  On the screen, Tom is a grown man in his 20s. 122. TOM: I\\'ve got a surprise for you, Dad. You\\'re a grandpa.  Tom holds up an infant wrapped tight in swaddling. The kid is BAWLING. MURPH: Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.  He laughs, self-conscious. Cooper pauses the message. He looks carefully at the screen:\\r  Murph is wearing his dad\\'s watch.  Cooper lets the message play. Tears are streaming down his face. OFF CAMERA): Good luck, old man. I hope you made it. I really do.  The video cuts out. 124. A message appears on the screen:\\r  \"Final transmission.\" Relay powered down 05232087  Cooper turns off the screen. INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE:  Cooper is seated, alone. Almost every compartment has been opened and emptied -- debris is swirling through the compartment.  Brand walks in. They sit in silence for a moment. When Cooper speaks, it\\'s clear his sadness has faded to a gallows humor.', 'COOPER: Not a single drink on the whole ship. What kind of mission is this?', \"BRAND: I think Doyle's been experimenting with the coolant from his spacesuit.  They sit in silence for a moment.\", \"COOPER: You really think we're the last humans alive anywhere?\", \"BRAND: I don't know. Maybe. (looks him in the eye) Yes.\", \"COOPER: So that's it, then? That's all?  He looks down, saddened by his own words.\", 'COOPER: What about the plan? The grand scheme. 125.', \"BRAND: I thought you didn't believe in one.\", \"COOPER: I didn't. But you were bringing me round.  He laughs, his anger coming and going in waves.\", \"BRAND: I don't know. Maybe it just adds up to this.\", \"COOPER: This? You're saying the end result of ten billion years is the atoms from dead stars standing here disagreeing with each other.  She smiles at him. Bittersweet.\", \"BRAND: Maybe that's enough.  He turns away from her. She takes his shoulder.  She pulls him into a kiss. His surprise disappears and he pulls her to him, kissing her back.  Their surroundings forgotten, they drift. She LAUGHS gently as they bump into a wall and he pushes off of it, sending them spinning back into the center of the cabin.  She pulls his shirt off and it hangs in space. In moments, the cabin is filling with discarded clothes, different colors and shapes, like a ticker tape parade.  In the center of the cabin, Brand and Cooper make love. INT. CREW QUARTERS, ENDURANCE -- LATER:  Cooper and Brand embrace, sleeping, drifting in the cabin.  Suddenly, Doyle's voice calls out from the other cabin. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE:  Cooper hauls himself up into the upper cabin. Doyle is standing in the middle of the chamber. DOYLE: They just appeared.  A sphere of distortion, like the one they encountered in the first wormhole, is directly in front of Doyle, hovering at a point in the middle of the cabin.  Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere, which grows in response.  Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points appear, as if they've been summoned by the first.  Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of them are motionless. BRAND: I think these are the creatures that built the wormhole.  One of them begins to move closer to Cooper.\", 'COOPER: This thing is made of... gravity?', \"BRAND: No. I don't think it's in our universe at all. I think it lives in the bulk -- the space that the wormholes traverse. And it can only interact with us using gravity.  The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the space it's in, stretching the skin.  Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body, coming to rest in the middle and bending his entire torso like a fun house mirror.  Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around Cooper's hand begins moving, tugging him gently through the cabin.  In the next moment, all three of them are being propelled through the cabin.  It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between creatures on either side of a massive, invisible wall.  Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled around the room. 127.  Cooper and Brand collide with each other for a second as the bulk beings move them through space. They hold onto each other for a moment and then are pulled apart again as the whirling dance continues.  Even the fractal creature is involved -- inside its cage, a tiny distortion ripples its fractal skin. The creature breaks apart and plays with the distortion around its enclosure.  Finally, Brand disengages from the dance and pulls herself around the lab, looking for some way to try to communicate with the creatures.  She finds two heavy pieces of engineering equipment and moves them close to each other, then far apart.  The bulk beings soon join her, mimicking the motion of the pieces of equipment.\", 'COOPER: Can we communicate with them?', \"BRAND: Where would we even start? Maybe--  She pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and tears the bag open, releasing a cloud of the tiny shining globes into the air.  For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the distortions begin moving through the bearings, shifting them, rearranging them into patterns in the air.  First, they rearrange the ball bearings into clusters, then shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around a medium-sized star. DOYLE: That's our solar system.  After a moment the ball bearings break apart again and rearrange into a larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua, Pantagruel, and the ice planet.  Finally, the bearings compress to a two-dimensional sheet. Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits around the stars and then pushes up, off of the sheet, into an umbrella shaped space that rises up from the sheet.\", 'COOPER: What is that?  Brand looks at the tiny particle, floating alone above its universe. 128.', \"BRAND: That's us. That's where they've brought us. We're in the bulk.  Cooper and Doyle stare at the particle. The map is static now.  Cooper looks around. The distortions have gone. The instruments on the ship TONE in alarm.  Cooper walks through the map, sending the ball bearings scattering. He hurries to the instruments. The ship is moving -- picking up speed at a huge rate. DOYLE: Where?  They stand, looking out into the perfect darkness. EXT. ENDURANCE, VACUUM: The ship begins to close in on something in the darkness: a\\r tiny point of light.  As they grow closer, they realize that it's an opening. They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been the entire time.  The ship is guided out through the opening at the crown of the sphere. Below them is an astonishing sight:\\r  Our entire universe, compressed into a flattened disc, like a floor of stars. They are hovering above it, in the bulk, the space between universes. INT. ENDURANCE, BULK:  Brand and the others stare at the incredible display.  The ship drops down and begins to orbit around the massive hollow sphere between them and our universe, lower and lower until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere.  In the distance, they can make out a cluster of lights.\", \"COOPER: There's something out there.\", \"The cluster of lights grows as they are propelled closer:\\r 129.  It's a massive space station, built onto the surface of the sphere. EXT. SPACE STATION:  The Endurance glides to a gentle stop on one of the upper decks of the space station.  After a moment, the airlock to the ship opens and Cooper and the others step out, in their suits.  They walk up to the airlock doors of the station, which open automatically. INT. SPACE STATION:  After the airlock decompresses, the inner doors open. Standing there, waiting for them, is a familiar figure:\\r  Tars. INT. GRAND LABORATORY, SPACE STATION:  The humans have taken off their space suits -- the station has been built to be habitable by humans -- and are following Tars through the massive facility. TARS: I orbited the black hole seven times before I hit the second wormhole. Then I drifted until I found this place.  Cooper looks around. The halls are filled with countless technological wonders.\", 'COOPER: This is what the Chinese were protecting.', \"TARS: They didn't. It took them four thousand. (off Brand's look) Time moves very slowly here 130. BRAND: How do you know? TARS: Because I've been waiting for you for three hundred years.  Brand looks around at the massive facility. BRAND: Time. That's what the bulk beings wanted to give us. That was the treasure the Chinese found. Enough time to let us save ourselves.  Brand looks around. The facility is massive. She sets the specimen case down on a table. Even the tiny creature seems in awe of the place. INT. LABORATORY, SPACE STATION:  Tars shows them a prototype for the gravity machine. It is tiny -- increasing G around two spheres that attract each other with a tiny force. TARS: I have catalogued almost everything they had built here.\", 'COOPER: Must have taken you a while.', 'TARS: One hundred and fifty-seven years.  Cooper shakes his head in disbelief.', 'COOPER: How are they keeping the lights on in this thing?  Tars, in answer, points to a far door.', \"TARS: Follow me. INT. ENGINE ROOM, SPACE STATION:  A massive reinforced-concrete shell shudders with the energy contained within it. The whole room HUMS with power. Tars pulls up a display showing the inside of the shell:\\r  A tiny black hole spins, spewing out massive amounts of power. 131. TARS: It's a mini black hole. A remnant of the big bang. It will power this place forever.  Tars leads them on. EXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION:  Tars leads them past an incredibly sleek fleet of spacecraft. Cooper starts to stop, but Tars doesn't slow down. INT. SIMULATION ROOM:  In the center of the room is a giant holographic globe of the Earth, perfect down to the tiniest detail.\", \"COOPER: It's a map?\", 'TARS: No. Not a map. This is a simulation of the Earth. A perfect simulation.  Tars touches the control panel. The map zooms in over Europe. Down onto Paris. Late 20th century:\\r  People walk through the streets. A woman stops at a newsagent to buy a newspaper.  Tars touches the controls again and the map zooms out.', \"COOPER: So why didn't they return? Why didn't they save us?  Brand is staring at the massive map.\", 'BRAND: Because they were too late. By the time they found this place, the people who sent them were dead. They were unable to fulfill their mission.  Tars points to the next room. TARS: That was the final problem they tried to solve.  Tars moves on. EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION:  Above them, the blackness of the sky is punctuated with hundreds of crystal shapes, faintly leaking starlight:\\r  Wormholes. Brand looks up at them, entranced. BRAND: Where do they lead?  Tars looks at an illuminated schematic on one wall, mapping some of the wormholes. TARS: There are millions of them, connecting virtually every planetary system in the universe. There are thousands in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese stopped mapping them when they found what they were looking for.  Tars walks further. He stops.  The platform in front of them is dominated by a gigantic version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet, connected to a massive power array, and pointing into the dark space above the sphere. 133. DOYLE: What does it do?  Cooper steps forward. Runs a hand on the cold, strange material the antenna is made out of. He knows exactly what it does.', \"COOPER: They weren't interested in the other wormholes because their mission was to return home. That one leads back to Earth. The Earth they were told to return to.  Tars walks to the controls for the device.\", \"BRAND: But that's impossible...  Tars turns away from the machine. TARS: It was only used once. The Chinese team attempted to travel back in time, to Earth just a few years after they had left.\", 'COOPER: Did they make it?', \"TARS: I don't know.  Doyle looks back to Cooper. DOYLE: Do you really think it works?  Cooper looks up at the machine, suddenly determined.\", \"COOPER: We're going to find out.  Cooper walks out of the room. Brand follows him. 134.\", \"EXT. AIRLOCK, SPACE STATION:  Brand follows Cooper as he walks up to the Endurance. BRAND: You know it doesn't work. Time travel isn't possible.\", \"COOPER: You don't know that.\", 'BRAND: Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese would have suddenly discovered all of these incredible technologies. But they never made it.', 'COOPER: I made a promise.  He turns away from her, resolute.', 'EXT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION:  Cooper and Doyle check over one of the sleek Chinese spaceships. 135. INT. CHINESE SPACESHIP:  Cooper is checking over the controls of the ship. Brand walks in. BRAND: I came to say goodbye.  Cooper looks up at her. INT. HANGAR, SPACE STATION:  Cooper walks Brand back to the Endurance. The ship is packed up and repaired. Brand is looking over their work.', 'COOPER: You could have taken one of the other ships.', \"BRAND: This one's done all right by us so far.  Brand holds up a small sample case containing half of the fractal life-form.\", 'COOPER: Where are you going to go?', \"BRAND: I don't know. Up there, I guess.  She points up into the great darkness above them.  Tars steps down. Moves over to them.\", \"COOPER: You're going, too?\", \"TARS: I'm curious. It's my nature. See you down the road?  Tars shakes Cooper's hand. Heads onto the Endurance. 136. BRAND: Come with us. Please. You wanted your whole life to explore. This is your chance.  Cooper stares at her. This is what he has always wanted. And he has to turn it down.\", \"COOPER: I'm sorry. I have to find out what happened to my sons. I promised them.  Brand sees the resolve in his eyes. Knows there's no way to change his mind.\", \"BRAND: You're a man who keeps his promises. Make me one-  She takes his hand.\", 'COOPER: I promise.  They kiss passionately. Not wanting it to end but knowing that it must. Reluctantly, they separate. Brand turns back to the ship.  She pulls herself onto the ship. Cooper steps back outside and watches through the tiny window as the Endurance lifts off and disappears into the darkness.  Cooper turns away.', \"EXT. PLATFORM, SPACE STATION:  Cooper watches as radiation pours out of the wormhole high above them. INT. CHINESE SPACESHIP:  Cooper pulls himself on board. Doyle is at the controls. He keys the controls and the ship lifts off. DOYLE: Let's go home.  The two men sit in silence as the ship arcs away from the space station and closes in on the wormhole. Cooper hears a familiar CHIRP. He turns around:\\r 137.  The probe they took from the ice planet is belted securely into one of the seats, filled with the garbled machine code of the gravitational machine.\", 'COOPER: The probe...  Doyle looks back.', 'DOYLE: We get back to earth, you and I can try to make sense of the code. Rebuild the gravity machine.  Cooper stares at it, suddenly realizing something. He unbuckles himself.  Cooper stands and walks over to the probe. Traces the familiar stars and stripes carved into its side.  Cooper stares at the probe, putting it all together.', \"COOPER: It's going to work.\", \"DOYLE: Of course it's going to work.\", \"COOPER: That's not what I mean. This is the probe I found in Galveston.  Below them, the wormhole breaks as it reaches another wormhole mouth that the Chinese have dropped down to a lower gravity well, creating a time machine.  The wormhole mouth is FLARING with radiation.\", \"DOYLE: I don't know what you're talking about, but you're not touching the controls. I'm going home. 138.  Cooper moves closer to Doyle. Doyle pulls out the flair gun. Points it at Cooper.\", \"COOPER: You don't need to do this. We won't make it back, but this does. The secrets are already right on it. Maybe someone found it. There's hope.\", \"DOYLE: You're not stopping me. I'm going home.  Doyle forces Cooper into the ship's lander. Then he closes the airlock.  Cooper pounds on the other side of the glass, trying to reason with him.  The landing craft detaches from the ship. INT. CHINESE LANDING CRAFT:  Cooper watches, helpless, as Doyle's ship races ahead towards the glowing wormhole mouth.  As the ship speeds toward the next wormhole, the radiation suddenly FLARES, annihilating the ship and everything in it.  Almost everything.  Cooper's landing craft spins away from the wormhole mouth. CUT TO:: EXT. SPACE, OUR SOLAR SYSTEM:  A hole opens in the sky with a FIERY EXPLOSION. As the radiation subsides, all that shoots out of the hole is a vaporous wisp of atomized metal, and a burned, blackened probe, which hurtles toward Earth. EXT. SPACE, NEAR EARTH ORBIT:  The probe collides with a satellite, hurling debris into the upper atmosphere. PROBE'S ONBOARD CAMERA P.O.V. --:  The probe's onboard camera documents its journey. Fragments OF VIDEO:: 139.  -- The probe HURTLES through the atmosphere, toward North America, the Gulf Coast.  -- The probe SMASHES down into a sandbar.  -- Daylight. A man is descending toward it, dangling from a rope. It's Cooper.  -- Night. A kitchen. A little boy -- Murph -- stares at the probe, while Cooper works at it with a blowtorch.  -- Tars pulls the probe out of the back of a plane.  -- Brand's father, older, studies the probe. Gives up.  -- Much later. People are moving around in the darkened base, scavenging equipment. CUT TO:: EXT. FIELD -- DAY:  A combine harvester is dead in a field, service hatch opened. A MAN is lying under the machine, working.  The man hauls himself out from under the huge machine. Dusts himself off.  It's Murph, 30s. He looks at the FARMER who is waiting for the verdict. Murph shakes his head. MURPH: It's done. Auto-pilot's packed up for the last time. FARMER: You can't make it work a little longer? MURPH: Can't do anything for you. There aren't any more parts for these. Not anywhere. FARMER: You don't understand. We're getting less than a hundred pounds per acre. We need to plant more, not less.  Murph looks around him at the pathetic crop of corn that stretches around them. The plants are feeble, barely able to support themselves. 140. INT. HANGAR -- DAY:  Murph stares at the darkened shape of a plane under a tarp. He stares at the tarp, unsure if he wants to keep going.  He pulls the tarp off, revealing Cooper's old Piper Cub. He checks over the engine, lights, prop. Turns the key. Fires her up. The diesel wakes with a GRUNT. EXT. AIRSTRIP -- DAY:  Murph wheels the old plane out onto the field by hand. EXT. SKIES OVER THE SOUTHWEST -- DAY:  The ancient plane skirts the San Gabriels. EXT. FIELD, SANTA CRUZ ISLAND:  Murph sets the plane down.  He parks the plane under a copse of trees and climbs down.  He scans the horizon. Nothing. Is this the place? EXT. FOREST -- DAY:  Murph pushes his way through the undergrowth. Stops.  He's standing at the blast doors to the facility. They've been blown open with dynamite. INT. NASA FACILITY -- DAY:  Murph lets himself inside. Lights a flare.  The place has been gutted. Thieves and scavengers have taken almost everything.  Murph finds one of the robots, or what's left of it -- it's been stripped, leaving only the bare composite skeleton. The empty eye sockets stare back at Murph.  Murph looks around the place. There is nothing left to salvage. He turns to leave. Hears a familiar CHIRP. In the corner, under a pile of rain-soaked garbage:\\r 141.  The probe.  No one has bothered to steal it. Murph stares at it. INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY -- NIGHT:  Murph sweeps detritus off of an ancient computer mainframe that survived the looting. He hooks the probe up to it.  After a minute, the screen fills with a picture of an ice- covered planet. Then nothing. The rest of the probe's drive is filled with garbage, noise.  Murph switches off the screen.  He stands. Begins to leave without the probe. Stops. Turns back. Picks it up and takes it with him. INT. KITCHEN, MURPH'S HOUSE -- NIGHT:  Murph is hunched over the probe, trying to pull data off of it with a defibrillator. He has incorporated an ancient laptop into the chain, and is tweaking values on it, trying to decrypt the contents.  His WIFE, several months pregnant, turns back to him from the stove. MURPH'S WIFE: Would you get that thing off of the table?  Murph nods, absorbed. Keys in a final tweak to the decryption software. Hits return.  Suddenly, the screen begins filling with data.  Murph stares at it, wide eyed. CUT TO:: INT. BARN -- NIGHT:  Murph, now in his 40s, is putting the finishing touches on a large machine. Although slightly different, we recognize some of the components and their configuration:\\r  It's a crude version of the gravitational device.  Murph double checks it, then fires up a small gas powered generator. Throws a breaker, feeding power to the unit.  The unit lights up. HUMS. But nothing happens. 142.  Murph, disappointed but undaunted, shuts it down and begins checking it over. He hears a noise at the door. Turns back. His daughter, Emily, 8, is standing at the door. EMILY COOPER: Dad? You said you'd take us to the game. EMILY COOPER: (staring at machine) What is it supposed to do, Dad? MURPH: I have no idea.  Murph switches off the lights and they walk out.  After a moment, the radio CRACKLES to life in the darkness.\", \"COOPER: (over radio, garbled) This is the crew of the Endurance... Murph... I'm sorry...  The signal crackles out.\", 'CUT TO:: INT. KITCHEN, MURPH\\'S HOUSE -- DAY:  Murph, 50s, slightly gray, sits at his kitchen table. He hears a distant RUMBLE.  He looks up. His wife is standing by the sink. MURPH: Where\\'s Emily? WIFE: Out in the barn. She\\'s been tinkering with your old projects. 143.  Murph stands up. The roof of the barn is visibly shaking. He steps outside. EXT. YARD, MURPH\\'S HOUSE -- DAY:  Murph moves towards the barn, concerned. The shaking is growing stronger -- the entire structure is buckling.  Emily, now 18, backs out of the barn. EMILY COOPER: Dad... I\\'m sorry... I made some changes to the machine. I think I did something wrong.  Murph puts an arm around his daughter and as they watch, the entire barn IMPLODES. Their tractor begins sliding towards the wreckage of the barn, chunky tires plowing up the soil.  Finally, the RUMBLING STOPS as the power lines short out in a FIERY display. As the dust clears, Murph and his daughter examine the mess:\\r  The entire barn has been crushed into a tiny ball.  Murph looks at his daughter. MURPH: Do you remember what you changed?  Wide-eyed, she thinks about it. Then nods. CUT TO:: EXT. EARTH, 2320 -- DAY:  This is North America. But it doesn\\'t look much like it.  Mother Nature has just about wiped the slate clean. Most of the vegetation is gone, and unchecked winds sweep across the barren plains. Patches of ice lie think on the ground, as if a heavy snow has come and gone. SUPER TITLE: \"TWO HUNDRED YEARS LATER\":  One of the Chinese spaceships descends through the thick clouds above and settles gently onto the plain.  The hatch opens and Cooper steps out. He takes a cautious look around. He is holding the fractal life in its small container.  The clouds are threatening, but the weather looks calm enough right here. 144.  Cooper starts to walk. EXT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY:  Remarkably, part of Cooper\\'s old house is still standing. INT. COLLAPSED HOUSE -- DAY:  Cooper stands in the middle of his kitchen. Two walls are missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. But he can still see where he used to feed his kids breakfast.  He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late.  Cooper hunkers down, staring at the space where his kids used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica.  It has taken him years to finally reach this place. He has had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find. But nothing has prepared him for this:\\r  He is completely alone. Nothing is left. INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT:  Cooper is still sitting there when the ice storm hits.  Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through the house, blasting Cooper and pelting what\\'s left of the structure with fist-sized hail.  Cooper takes shelter against the remaining wall. He\\'s going to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the brutal descendants of the weather he knew. They\\'ll finish him off if he steps back outside.  As he watches, the pool of water on the kitchen floor freezes over in seconds. INT. COLLAPSED FARMHOUSE -- DAWN:  Cooper shivers, pressed against the wall. The storm is still raging outside. He is freezing to death. He has to move now or he will die. He pulls the hood tight around his face and stumbles outside. EXT. SNOWBOUND FIELD -- DAY:  Cooper makes his way through the blinding snow. He tries to find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard.  He stumbles to the ground, dropping the glass case with the fractal wildlife in it. The case shatters.  Cooper tries to stand back up, but his strength is dwindling. 145.  As he watches, the fractal wildlife creeps tentatively out of its broken habitat. It forms together against the cold.  After a moment, it burrows into the ice. As it does, the ice glows faintly. It seems to be right at home.  Cooper laughs, glimpsing the outline of a plan. Was this what the beings who made the wormhole intended all along?  Cooper suddenly spots the outline of the ship through the driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles a few more steps, then stumbles again, spent.  Finally, he sits down in the snow to die.  As his senses flicker in and out, he is struck with memories of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling forward in the snow.  He stops, and laughs, remembering what Case told him about what happens when humans die.  He struggles to his feet and stumbles a few more feet, eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship.  Cooper takes a final step. Finally, he collapses under his ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him.  As the snow clears for a moment, Cooper is alone on a vast arctic tundra. He will die alone. BLACK: FADE IN:: INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY:  Cooper wakes.  He is in a sunlit room. A breeze rustles the curtains as it makes its way in through a large open window.  Cooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall TONES gently, as if in response to his movement.  He stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the open windows and hear people -- kids YELLING as they play. He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains. Before he can, the door opens behind him.  A WOMAN in a white coat steps in, smiling warmly. DOCTOR: Good morning. Don\\'t go outside just yet, Mr. Cooper.', 'COOPER: Where am I?', \"COOPER: What's coincidence? What is this place?\", \"DOCTOR: We have a lot to show you.  The doctor reaches for the curtains. She offers him a hand. Cooper declines the help and steps outside. EXT. HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY:  Cooper is standing on a rooftop deck of a four-story building in a medium-sized city surrounded by fields. But as the road and the buildings stretch into the distance, the landscape curves up, not down.  The entire landscape is contained within a huge cylinder- shaped space station.  Cooper stumbles, and reaches instinctively out. The doctor catches him. DOCTOR: You're OK. We get this from people who move here from planetary colonies all the time. 147.\", 'COOPER: Where... where are we?', \"DOCTOR: Like I said. It was a coincidence. There was a facility closer to Earth, but they had a problem, so you wound up here. (off his look) This is the Space Station Joseph A. Cooper.  Cooper takes in the incredible surroundings. A thousand feet above them, black specks are sprinkled over an ocean of green -- Jersey milking cows grazing in a field of wild grass. INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM, HOSPICE, COOPER STATION -- DAY:  Cooper steps inside. The room is dark, still, the only noise is the labored RATTLE of an old man struggling to breathe.  Cooper steps closer to the bed. The man's skin is paper- thin. He is ancient. DOCTOR: He was moved here after they found you. He's a little old for a transfer, but they made an exception.  Cooper hovers at the back of the room, unsure. He turns to the doctor, questioning. Then he notices the pictures on the old man's desk:\\r  There are dozens of them. Children, grandchildren. Then the older ones -- the man's own parents. Grandparents. Cooper spots a tiny framed picture with someone he recognizes:\\r  Murph, 80 years old, surrounded by his daughter and her family. They are standing in front of a re-opened Cape Canaveral, and a huge spaceship under construction.  Cooper picks up the picture and stares at it.  The doctor points to a shy little boy hiding behind Murph's leg in the picture. CUT TO:: EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- MORNING:  Cooper is sitting in a well-appointed office. A middle-aged BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk. ADMINISTRATOR: You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's just start off by saying that. It's an incredible and... unexpected honor to have you here with us.  Cooper smiles, uncomfortable.\", 'COOPER: Shoot. 149.', 'ADMINISTRATOR: The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild. Which is, unfortunately, against regulations.', 'COOPER: It was last of its kind. Their planet was destroyed.  The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer.', 'ADMINISTRATOR: The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form, but it had already spread out of control. It seems to be thriving.  He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america. A considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing.  Cooper begins laughing. Which makes the administrator even less comfortable.', 'COOPER: Because that was the plan.', \"ADMINISTRATOR: Whose plan? ADMINISTRATOR: My assistant tells me you've applied for a position with the exploration fleet.\", 'COOPER: Feel like I should be pulling my weight. 150.', \"ADMINISTRATOR: That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The truth is, most of the fleet's personnel are automated. There are a small number of crewed ships. But there are great numbers of candidates. Very well trained candidates.\", 'COOPER: I was hoping to enroll in a course. Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems.', \"ADMINISTRATOR: I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I said, you're a hero. But the truth is we have somewhat limited resources.  Cooper remembers this conversation. He looks down.\", \"COOPER: No one's heard anything from Brand?\", \"ADMINISTRATOR: I'm sorry. Officially, she's been listed as missing for over 200 years. Mind you, I guess you turned up eventually, didn't you?\", 'COOPER: Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her? I just need a small ship. I made a promise.  The bureaucrat looks down. Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land?', \"ADMINISTRATOR: Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero. You're the oldest man in the human race. Don't you want to take it easy? (off his look) I hope you understand, we all you hold you in the highest possible regard. EXT. CORNFIELD, COOPER STATION -- DAY:  Corn blows in an artificial breeze. A red tractor makes its way through the field, which curves gently up in the distance. EXT. HANGAR BAY, COOPER STATION:  Cooper stands on an observation deck, high above the hangar floor. Below him, bright young things in uniforms climb into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out. EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, COOPER STATION:  Cooper sits in the stands, listening to the familiar crack of the bat as an intramural team from the university practices.  Cooper watches. He looks bored.  The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position. But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.  Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward the town center above.  After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a building high above them.  Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing. 152. INT. KITCHEN, FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- DAY:  Cooper's robot sits at the kitchen table. Cooper is fiddling around in the back of his head. ROBOT: Settings: general settings, security SETTINGS--:\", 'COOPER: Curiosity. New level setting. 100 percent.', 'ROBOT: Confirmed. Would you like to make any additional changes?', 'COOPER: Sense of humor. New level setting. 100 percent. Wait.', \"EXT. FARMHOUSE, COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT:  Cooper sits on his porch, joined by the same robot as before. They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of alignment with the local star, casting the inside of the cylinder into shade, then darkness.  The shadow races past them. Another day. Another night. EXT. HANGAR, COOPER STATION:  A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek- looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.  After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar floor, sticking to the shadows.  As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.  Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with a click against the mirror-like floor.  Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.  Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes. Nothing happens. He punches in a few more. 153.  Suddenly, the hatch opens with a HISS. INT. SHIP:  Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship. Looks over the controls. The robot straps himself in next to him. Cooper looks up through the windows.  The inky black void of space beckons.  Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls.\", 'COOPER: Where do you want to go first?  The robot thinks it over.']\n",

As when I asked how did Cooper maintain hope along the 20+ years journey, the model accurately stated thing which mean that's the video he send message to Earth for his family with Dr. Brand looks at him.

The reason is that unlike the script of finding Nemo which has \"\\r\\n\" to seperate character and their script, then \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\" between different character's. The script I am using only contain \"\\r\\n\" so if I split \"\\r\\n\\r\\n\" all text are gone. That's why I need to split then use pattern matching as well as sentence joining to be able to prepare the dataset to fine-tune DialoGPT.\n",

        "As a consequence, there are sometimes the character's name is extracted wrongly. For instance, the locations like \"INT. LAUNCH TUBES, NUCLEAR SUB, UNDERWATER -- DAY\" are capitalized the same way as the character. Or with the chosen character Cooper, the text sometimes put his name as \"COOPER (CONT'D)\" so I need to find a way to remove it so there are more context for the characters for the model to learn from.\n",
        "\n",
        "Secondly, this text only contain 488 dialogues compared to 710 dialogues in the practice notebook so there will be less information for the model to learn from.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, I feel that my effort definitely worth it. The reason is that most of the movie script from imsdb.com have the similar structure to the one I am using so by being able to properly extract the text from Interstellar, I will be able to fine-tune DialoGPT following many of the movie from imsdb.com"
