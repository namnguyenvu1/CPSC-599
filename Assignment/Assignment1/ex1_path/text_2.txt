In this article, we describe our early efforts with sentiment analysis on tweets. This project is meant to extract sentiment from tweets depending on their topic matter. It utilizes natural language processing methods to determine the emotion associated with a certain issue. We used three different approaches to identify emotions in our study: classification based on subjectivity, semantic association and classification based on polarity. The experiment makes advantage of emotion lexicons by establishing the grammatical relationship between them and the subject. Due to the unique structure of tweets, the proposed method outperforms current text sentiment analysis methods.
