Implicit=while Thesefarmers may have a grip on the world’s very heartComparison.ContrastUnderstanding discourse also involves solving other problems like anaphora resolution andmetonymy detection. In anaphora resolution, we want to resolve occurrences of pronouns to theentities to which they refer. This can become a complicated problem, as 
Figure 9-2 illustrates.
Figure 9-2. Some issues with anaphora resolution. In example (a), does “It” refer to the dog or the bone?In example (b), “It” refers to neither of them. In examples (c) and (d), “It” refers to the glass and thebeer, respectively. Knowing beer is more likely to be bubbly is critical in resolving such referents(selectional preferences).Referents can also be metonyms, as illustrated in this example:Beijing imposed trade tariffs in response to tariffs on Chinese goods.Here, Beijing refers to not a location but to the Chinese government. Sometimes, successfullyresolving referents might require working with a knowledge base.2
